# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a foundational paradigm in software development. This guide will take you through the core OOP principles in C# with clear explanations, full code examples with comments, and practical best practices.

## Core OOP Principles

1. **Encapsulation**

   * **What:** Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
   * **Why:** Protects data integrity and simplifies maintenance.
   * **How:** Use access modifiers (private, public, protected, internal).

### Code Example (Encapsulation)

```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance; // Private field (Encapsulated)

    public decimal GetBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
        {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance)
        {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Inheritance**

   * **What:** A mechanism to create a new class using properties and behaviors of an existing class.
   * **Why:** Promotes code reuse and hierarchical relationships.
   * **How:** Use the `: baseClass` syntax in C#.

### Code Example (Inheritance)

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating");
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark() => Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking");
}
}
```

3. **Polymorphism**

   * **What:** The ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same type.
   * **Why:** Allows for flexible and scalable code.
   * **How:** Achieved through method overriding and interfaces.

### Code Example (Polymorphism)

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound");
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Cat meows");
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
}
```

4. **Abstraction**

   * **What:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality.
   * **Why:** Simplifies interface usage and increases security.
   * **How:** Use abstract classes or interfaces.

### Code Example (Abstraction)

```csharp
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double CalculateArea();
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius)
    {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

## Watchouts, Do's and Don'ts

* **Encapsulation:** Avoid making fields public; always use properties.
* **Inheritance:** Prefer composition over inheritance if there is no "is-a" relationship.
* **Polymorphism:** Always use `override` when overriding methods.
* **Abstraction:** Keep abstract methods generic; avoid implementation logic in abstract classes.

## Summary: Questions and Answers

1. **What is Encapsulation?**

   * Encapsulation is the concept of hiding internal data and exposing only necessary methods.

2. **How does Inheritance promote code reuse?**

   * Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.

3. **What is Polymorphism, and how is it achieved in C#?**

   * Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as the same type, achieved using method overriding and interfaces.

4. **What is the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface?**

   * Abstract classes can have implementations, while interfaces only define methods.

5. **How do you achieve encapsulation in C#?**

   * By using access modifiers (private, public, protected) to control access to fields and methods.

6. **When should you use Interfaces over Abstract Classes?**

   * Use interfaces for pure contracts without implementation, and abstract classes for partial implementations.

7. **What are the key differences between Inheritance and Composition?**

   * Inheritance creates an "is-a" relationship, while composition creates a "has-a" relationship.

8. **How can Polymorphism lead to flexible code?**

   * It allows methods to be called on objects of different types without knowing their specific type.

9. **What are access modifiers in C#?**

   * Access modifiers define the visibility of class members (public, private, protected, internal).

10. **What are the benefits of using OOP principles?**

* OOP promotes modular, maintainable, reusable, and scalable code.


# SOLID Principles and Design Patterns

## Section 1: SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

   * **What:** A class should have only one reason to change.
   * **Why:** This promotes maintainability and avoids tightly coupled code.
   * **How:** Separate responsibilities into distinct classes.

### Code Example (SRP)

```csharp
public class Order
{
    public void PlaceOrder() => Console.WriteLine("Order Placed.");
}

public class OrderLogger
{
    public void LogOrder() => Console.WriteLine("Order Logged.");
}
```

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

   * **What:** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   * **Why:** This allows new features without altering existing code.
   * **How:** Use inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.

### Code Example (OCP)

```csharp
public interface IDiscount
{
    double ApplyDiscount(double amount);
}

public class NoDiscount : IDiscount
{
    public double ApplyDiscount(double amount) => amount;
}

public class SeasonalDiscount : IDiscount
{
    public double ApplyDiscount(double amount) => amount * 0.9;
}
```

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

   * **What:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
   * **Why:** Prevents unexpected behavior.
   * **How:** Use interfaces or base classes with clear contracts.

### Code Example (LSP)

```csharp
public class Bird
{
    public virtual void Fly() => Console.WriteLine("Bird is flying");
}

public class Sparrow : Bird { }

public class Ostrich : Bird
{
    public override void Fly() => throw new NotSupportedException("Ostrich cannot fly");
}
```

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

   * **What:** Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
   * **Why:** Promotes modularity and flexibility.
   * **How:** Create small, specific interfaces.

### Code Example (ISP)

```csharp
public interface IPrinter
{
    void Print();
}

public interface IScanner
{
    void Scan();
}

public class MultiFunctionPrinter : IPrinter, IScanner
{
    public void Print() => Console.WriteLine("Printing...");
    public void Scan() => Console.WriteLine("Scanning...");
}
```

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

   * **What:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
   * **Why:** Promotes decoupled code.
   * **How:** Use dependency injection and interfaces.

### Code Example (DIP)

```csharp
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

public class ConsoleLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message);
}

public class OrderService
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public OrderService(ILogger logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void ProcessOrder()
    {
        _logger.Log("Order processed.");
    }
}
```

## Section 2: Design Patterns (10 Most Common)

1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype
6. Adapter
7. Decorator
8. Observer
9. Strategy
10. Command

## Watchouts, Do's and Don'ts

* Avoid violating SOLID principles to keep code maintainable.
* Prefer interfaces over concrete classes for dependency injection.
* Ensure design patterns solve real problems, not add unnecessary complexity.

## Summary: Questions and Answers

1. **What is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?**

   * SRP means a class should only have one reason to change. It ensures that each class has one clear responsibility, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

2. **How does the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) support extensibility?**

   * OCP means classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. You can add new functionality without altering existing code, using polymorphism or inheritance.

3. **What is the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)?**

   * LSP means that objects of a derived class should be replaceable for objects of the base class without affecting program correctness.

4. **How do you achieve Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)?**

   * ISP means creating small, specific interfaces instead of one large interface, ensuring that classes only implement what they need.

5. **What is Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and why is it important?**

   * DIP means high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions, promoting loose coupling and testability.

6. **What is a Design Pattern? Why do we use them?**

   * A Design Pattern is a proven solution to a recurring problem in software design. They make software scalable, maintainable, and reusable.

7. **Explain the Singleton Pattern with an example.**

   * Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point. Example: Database connection manager.

8. **What is the difference between Factory and Abstract Factory Patterns?**

   * Factory creates objects without specifying the exact class, while Abstract Factory creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

9. **How does the Strategy Pattern promote flexibility?**

   * Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable at runtime, promoting flexible code.

10. **When should you use the Observer Pattern?**

* Use Observer Pattern when an object needs to notify multiple objects about state changes without tightly coupling them.

# 50 Common Design Patterns in C\#

## Introduction

Design Patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They provide templates for writing flexible, scalable, and maintainable code. This guide covers the 20 most common design patterns in C#, with full code implementations, detailed explanations, use cases, and best practices.

## Section 1: Creational Patterns

### 1. Singleton Pattern

* **Definition:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.
* **When to Use:** Use when you need to ensure only one instance of a class is created, such as a database connection.
* **Similar Patterns to Learn:** Factory Method, Abstract Factory.

```csharp
public sealed class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton _instance = null;
    private static readonly object _lock = new object();

    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            lock (_lock)
            {
                if (_instance == null)
                    _instance = new Singleton();
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Factory Method Pattern

* **Definition:** Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* **When to Use:** Use when you need to delegate object creation to subclasses.
* **Similar Patterns to Learn:** Abstract Factory, Builder.

```csharp
public interface IVehicle
{
    void Drive();
}

public class Car : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Driving a car.");
}

public class Bike : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Riding a bike.");
}

public class VehicleFactory
{
    public static IVehicle CreateVehicle(string type)
    {
        return type switch
        {
            "Car" => new Car(),
            "Bike" => new Bike(),
            _ => throw new ArgumentException("Invalid vehicle type")
        };
    }
}
```

### 3. Abstract Factory Pattern

* **Definition:** Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* **When to Use:** Use when your system needs to work with multiple related object families.
* **Similar Patterns to Learn:** Factory Method, Prototype.

```csharp
public interface IGUIFactory
{
    IButton CreateButton();
}

public class WindowsFactory : IGUIFactory
{
    public IButton CreateButton() => new WindowsButton();
}

public class MacOSFactory : IGUIFactory
{
    public IButton CreateButton() => new MacOSButton();
}
```

### 4. Builder Pattern

## Definition

* **Builder Pattern** is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
* It allows you to create a complex object step by step, giving you more control over the creation process.

## When to Use

* When the creation of an object is complex and involves multiple steps.
* When you want to construct different representations of the same complex object.
* When you want to ensure that the object creation process is clear and maintainable.

## Key Components

* **Builder Interface:** Defines the methods for building different parts of the product.
* **Concrete Builder:** Implements the builder interface to construct and assemble parts of the product.
* **Product:** The final complex object that is created by the builder.
* **Director:** Manages the construction process using the builder.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "Pizza Builder" in a restaurant. The customer (Director) specifies the ingredients and toppings, while the chef (Concrete Builder) uses these instructions to build the final pizza (Product).

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Product

```csharp
// The complex object being built
public class Computer
{
    public string CPU { get; set; }
    public string GPU { get; set; }
    public string RAM { get; set; }
    public string Storage { get; set; }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"CPU: {CPU}, GPU: {GPU}, RAM: {RAM}, Storage: {Storage}";
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Builder Interface

```csharp
// Builder interface specifying the building steps
public interface IComputerBuilder
{
    void SetCPU();
    void SetGPU();
    void SetRAM();
    void SetStorage();
    Computer GetComputer();
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Concrete Builder

```csharp
// Concrete builder implementing the builder interface
public class GamingComputerBuilder : IComputerBuilder
{
    private Computer _computer = new Computer();

    public void SetCPU() => _computer.CPU = "Intel i9";
    public void SetGPU() => _computer.GPU = "NVIDIA RTX 4090";
    public void SetRAM() => _computer.RAM = "32GB DDR5";
    public void SetStorage() => _computer.Storage = "1TB NVMe SSD";

    public Computer GetComputer() => _computer;
}
```

### Step 4: Implement the Director

```csharp
// Director manages the building process
public class ComputerDirector
{
    private readonly IComputerBuilder _builder;

    public ComputerDirector(IComputerBuilder builder)
    {
        _builder = builder;
    }

    public void BuildComputer()
    {
        _builder.SetCPU();
        _builder.SetGPU();
        _builder.SetRAM();
        _builder.SetStorage();
    }

    public Computer GetComputer() => _builder.GetComputer();
}
```

### Step 5: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the builder pattern
var builder = new GamingComputerBuilder();
var director = new ComputerDirector(builder);

director.BuildComputer();
var computer = director.GetComputer();
Console.WriteLine(computer);
```

### Output

```
CPU: Intel i9, GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4090, RAM: 32GB DDR5, Storage: 1TB NVMe SSD
```

## Benefits

* Simplifies object creation with clear steps.
* Makes the creation process flexible and customizable.
* Enforces a step-by-step construction process.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Factory Method:** For creating objects without specifying their exact class.
* **Prototype Pattern:** For creating object clones.

## Common Mistakes (Watchouts)

* Using Builder for simple objects (overkill).
* Mixing Builder responsibilities with Product responsibilities.

## Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Builder Pattern, and why would you use it?**

   * The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It is used when you need to construct a complex object step by step.

2. **How is the Builder Pattern different from the Factory Method Pattern?**

   * Builder Pattern constructs objects step by step, while Factory Method creates objects in one step without exposing the instantiation logic.

3. **What are the roles of the Director and Builder in the Builder Pattern?**

   * The Director manages the construction process, while the Builder handles the creation of the actual object step by step.

4. **Can the Builder Pattern be used without a Director? Why or why not?**

   * Yes, but it is less organized. The Director centralizes the building process, making it more maintainable.

5. **Give a real-world example where the Builder Pattern is most suitable.**

   * Building a complex object like a Computer, Burger, or Pizza where each item has multiple configurable options.

### 5. Prototype Pattern in C\#

## Definition

* **Prototype Pattern** is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object (cloning).
* It helps to avoid the cost of creating an object from scratch.

## When to Use

* When object creation is expensive or complex.
* When you want to create an object that is a copy of another existing object without modifying it.
* When you want to avoid a complex initialization process.

## Key Components

* **Prototype Interface:** Declares a cloning method (Clone).
* **Concrete Prototype:** Implements the cloning method for specific objects.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "Copy Machine" that creates an exact copy of a document. Instead of recreating the document from scratch, you simply make a clone.

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Prototype Interface

```csharp
// Prototype Interface specifying the Clone method
public interface IPrototype
{
    IPrototype Clone();
}
```

### Step 2: Create Concrete Prototype

```csharp
// Concrete prototype implementing the Clone method
public class Document : IPrototype
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Content { get; set; }

    public IPrototype Clone()
    {
        return (IPrototype)MemberwiseClone();
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"Title: {Title}, Content: {Content}";
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the prototype pattern
var originalDocument = new Document { Title = "Design Patterns", Content = "This is a guide on design patterns." };
var clonedDocument = (Document)originalDocument.Clone();

// Modifying the cloned document
clonedDocument.Title = "Cloned Document";

Console.WriteLine("Original: " + originalDocument);
Console.WriteLine("Cloned: " + clonedDocument);
```

### Output

```
Original: Title: Design Patterns, Content: This is a guide on design patterns.
Cloned: Title: Cloned Document, Content: This is a guide on design patterns.
```
## Benefits

* Reduces the cost of creating complex objects from scratch.
* Provides flexibility in creating copies without modifying the original object.

## What is `MemberwiseClone`?

* `MemberwiseClone` is a method defined in the base `Object` class of C#.
* It creates a **shallow copy** of the current object.
* A **shallow copy** means that all value-type fields are copied, but reference-type fields still point to the same objects in memory.

## Syntax:

```csharp
return (IPrototype)MemberwiseClone();
```

### Breaking Down the Code:

* **`MemberwiseClone`**: This method is called to create a shallow copy of the current object.
* **`(IPrototype)`**: This is a type cast. It converts the cloned object to the `IPrototype` interface type.
* **`return`**: The cloned object is returned to the caller.

## When to Use `MemberwiseClone`:

* Use it when you need to create a copy of an object but do not want to copy the referenced objects it contains.
* Commonly used in the **Prototype Design Pattern**, where objects are cloned rather than created from scratch.

## Example:

### Defining a Prototype Class:

```csharp
public interface IPrototype
{
    IPrototype Clone();
}

public class Person : IPrototype
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Address Address { get; set; }

    public IPrototype Clone()
    {
        return (IPrototype)MemberwiseClone();
    }
}

public class Address
{
    public string City { get; set; }
}
```

### Usage:

```csharp
Person original = new Person
{
    Name = "John",
    Address = new Address { City = "London" }
};

Person cloned = (Person)original.Clone();
cloned.Name = "Jane";
cloned.Address.City = "Paris";

Console.WriteLine(original.Name);     // Output: John
Console.WriteLine(original.Address.City); // Output: Paris (Shallow copy problem)
```

## Why Use Shallow Copy (MemberwiseClone)?

* It is fast and efficient for objects that primarily use value-type properties.
* It is useful for creating a quick copy without duplicating complex objects.

## Watchouts:

* Shallow copy can lead to unexpected changes if the object contains reference-type fields (like the `Address` in the example).
* For deep copying, you must manually clone reference-type fields.

## Best Practices:

* Use `MemberwiseClone` for simple, value-type objects.
* Use Deep Copy techniques for objects containing complex reference types.



## Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Builder Pattern:** For constructing complex objects step by step.
* **Abstract Factory:** For creating families of related objects.

## Common Mistakes (Watchouts)

* Not implementing deep cloning for complex objects with nested objects.
* Accidentally modifying the original object when using shallow copy.

## Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Prototype Pattern, and why would you use it?**

   * The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that creates objects by copying an existing object (clone). It is useful when object creation is expensive or complex.

2. **How is the Prototype Pattern different from the Builder Pattern?**

   * Prototype Pattern clones an existing object, while Builder Pattern constructs an object step by step.

3. **What is the difference between shallow and deep cloning?**

   * Shallow cloning copies only the top-level structure, while deep cloning copies all nested objects.

4. **How would you implement deep cloning in the Prototype Pattern?**

   * You would manually create a new instance of each nested object instead of using MemberwiseClone.

5. **Give a real-world example where the Prototype Pattern is most suitable.**

   * Creating copies of complex objects like character templates in a game or copying configuration objects in an application.

## Section 2: Structural Patterns

### 6. Adapter Pattern in C\#

## Definition

* **Adapter Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.
* It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, allowing them to communicate.

## When to Use

* When you want to use an existing class, but its interface is not compatible with the system you are working with.
* When you need to integrate classes that were not designed to work together.

## Key Components

* **Target Interface:** The interface that clients expect.
* **Adapter:** Converts the interface of the existing class to match the target interface.
* **Adaptee:** The existing class that needs to be adapted.
* **Client:** Uses the adapter to interact with the adaptee through the target interface.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of an "Electric Socket Adapter." The adapter allows you to plug a device with a different plug type into a socket.

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Target Interface

```csharp
// Target Interface - What the client expects
public interface IAudioPlayer
{
    void Play(string audioType, string fileName);
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Adaptee

```csharp
// Adaptee - Existing incompatible class
public class VLCPlayer
{
    public void PlayVLC(string fileName)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Playing VLC File: {fileName}");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Implement the Adapter

```csharp
// Adapter - Converts the interface of VLCPlayer to IAudioPlayer
public class MediaAdapter : IAudioPlayer
{
    private readonly VLCPlayer _vlcPlayer = new VLCPlayer();

    public void Play(string audioType, string fileName)
    {
        if (audioType.ToLower() == "vlc")
        {
            _vlcPlayer.PlayVLC(fileName);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Unsupported format");
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Create the Client

```csharp
// Client - Uses the Adapter
public class AudioPlayer : IAudioPlayer
{
    private readonly MediaAdapter _adapter = new MediaAdapter();

    public void Play(string audioType, string fileName)
    {
        if (audioType.ToLower() == "vlc")
        {
            _adapter.Play(audioType, fileName);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Playing MP3 File: " + fileName);
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the Adapter Pattern
var audioPlayer = new AudioPlayer();
audioPlayer.Play("mp3", "song.mp3");
audioPlayer.Play("vlc", "video.vlc");
audioPlayer.Play("mp4", "movie.mp4");
```

### Output

```
Playing MP3 File: song.mp3
Playing VLC File: video.vlc
Unsupported format
```

## Benefits

* Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
* Provides flexibility for extending existing systems.
* Promotes code reusability without modifying existing classes.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Bridge Pattern:** Separates an abstraction from its implementation, making them independent.
* **Proxy Pattern:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.

## Common Mistakes (Watchouts)

* Making the Adapter too complex, losing simplicity.
* Misusing Adapter when a simpler solution exists.

## Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Adapter Pattern, and why would you use it?**

   * The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. It is used to integrate incompatible classes.

2. **How is the Adapter Pattern different from the Bridge Pattern?**

   * Adapter makes two incompatible interfaces work together, while Bridge separates an abstraction from its implementation.

3. **What are the components of the Adapter Pattern?**

   * Target Interface, Adapter, Adaptee, and Client.

4. **Can you provide a real-world example of the Adapter Pattern?**

   * An electric socket adapter that allows a device with a different plug type to connect to a socket.

5. **How can you extend the Adapter Pattern to support more formats?**

   * You can enhance the adapter by adding more conditions and support for new formats in the Play method.

---

## 7. Bridge Pattern

## Definition

* **Bridge Pattern** is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation so that they can vary independently.
* It allows you to change the abstraction and the implementation independently without modifying each other.

## When to Use

* When you want to separate an abstraction from its implementation.
* When you want to avoid a rigid inheritance hierarchy.
* When you have multiple variations of an abstraction and you want to keep them decoupled.

## Key Components

* **Abstraction:** Defines the interface and maintains a reference to the implementer.
* **Implementer:** Defines the interface for implementation classes.
* **Concrete Implementer:** Provides specific implementations of the interface.
* **Refined Abstraction:** Extends the abstraction to add more functionality.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "Remote Control" (Abstraction) that can work with different devices like TV, Radio, or Projector (Implementer). The remote can vary independently of the device.

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Implementer Interface

```csharp
// Implementer - Defines the interface for devices
public interface IDevice
{
    void TurnOn();
    void TurnOff();
}
```

### Step 2: Create Concrete Implementers

```csharp
// Concrete Implementer 1 - TV
public class TV : IDevice
{
    public void TurnOn() => Console.WriteLine("TV is now ON.");
    public void TurnOff() => Console.WriteLine("TV is now OFF.");
}

// Concrete Implementer 2 - Radio
public class Radio : IDevice
{
    public void TurnOn() => Console.WriteLine("Radio is now ON.");
    public void TurnOff() => Console.WriteLine("Radio is now OFF.");
}
```

### Step 3: Create the Abstraction

```csharp
// Abstraction - Remote Control
public class RemoteControl
{
    protected IDevice _device;

    public RemoteControl(IDevice device)
    {
        _device = device;
    }

    public virtual void TogglePower()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Toggling Power...");
        _device.TurnOn();
        _device.TurnOff();
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Create Refined Abstraction

```csharp
// Refined Abstraction - Advanced Remote
public class AdvancedRemoteControl : RemoteControl
{
    public AdvancedRemoteControl(IDevice device) : base(device) { }

    public void Mute()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Muting Device...");
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the Bridge Pattern
var tvRemote = new RemoteControl(new TV());
tvRemote.TogglePower();

var radioRemote = new AdvancedRemoteControl(new Radio());
radioRemote.TogglePower();
((AdvancedRemoteControl)radioRemote).Mute();
```

### Output

```
Toggling Power...
TV is now ON.
TV is now OFF.
Toggling Power...
Radio is now ON.
Radio is now OFF.
Muting Device...
```

# Bridge Pattern Explained with Payment System Analogy

## Introduction

The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. This design pattern is especially useful when you have multiple variations of an abstraction and its implementations. It avoids the complexity of creating a single large class hierarchy that tries to handle both.

### What is Bridge Pattern?

* **Definition:** Separates an abstraction (concept) from its implementation (details).
* **Problem Solved:** Allows creating multiple variations of a concept (abstraction) without changing how it works (implementation).

### Real-World Analogy: Payment System

* **Abstraction (Payment Method):** Represents how customers pay (Credit Card, PayPal, Crypto).
* **Implementation (Product Type):** Represents what customers buy (Physical Product, Digital Product, Subscription).
* **Separation:** Customers can pay using any method (abstraction) for any product type (implementation) without directly linking them.

### Why Use Bridge Pattern?

* To decouple abstraction and implementation, allowing them to change independently.
* To make it easy to add new payment methods or new product types without modifying existing code.
* To avoid a complex inheritance hierarchy.

## Understanding with Code

### Step 1: Define the Payment Method (Abstraction)

```csharp
public interface IPaymentMethod
{
    void ProcessPayment(decimal amount);
}
```

### Step 2: Implement Payment Methods (Concrete Abstractions)

```csharp
public class CreditCardPayment : IPaymentMethod
{
    public void ProcessPayment(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing Credit Card Payment of ${amount}");
    }
}

public class PayPalPayment : IPaymentMethod
{
    public void ProcessPayment(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing PayPal Payment of ${amount}");
    }
}

public class CryptoPayment : IPaymentMethod
{
    public void ProcessPayment(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing Crypto Payment of ${amount}");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Define Product (Implementation)

```csharp
public abstract class Product
{
    protected IPaymentMethod paymentMethod;

    public Product(IPaymentMethod paymentMethod)
    {
        this.paymentMethod = paymentMethod;
    }

    public abstract void Purchase(decimal amount);
}
```

### Step 4: Implement Different Product Types

```csharp
public class PhysicalProduct : Product
{
    public PhysicalProduct(IPaymentMethod paymentMethod) : base(paymentMethod) { }

    public override void Purchase(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Purchasing Physical Product...");
        paymentMethod.ProcessPayment(amount);
    }
}

public class DigitalProduct : Product
{
    public DigitalProduct(IPaymentMethod paymentMethod) : base(paymentMethod) { }

    public override void Purchase(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Purchasing Digital Product...");
        paymentMethod.ProcessPayment(amount);
    }
}

public class SubscriptionProduct : Product
{
    public SubscriptionProduct(IPaymentMethod paymentMethod) : base(paymentMethod) { }

    public override void Purchase(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Purchasing Subscription Product...");
        paymentMethod.ProcessPayment(amount);
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Usage Example

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Buy Physical Product with Credit Card
        IPaymentMethod creditCard = new CreditCardPayment();
        Product physicalProduct = new PhysicalProduct(creditCard);
        physicalProduct.Purchase(50);

        // Buy Digital Product with PayPal
        IPaymentMethod paypal = new PayPalPayment();
        Product digitalProduct = new DigitalProduct(paypal);
        digitalProduct.Purchase(20);

        // Buy Subscription Product with Crypto
        IPaymentMethod crypto = new CryptoPayment();
        Product subscriptionProduct = new SubscriptionProduct(crypto);
        subscriptionProduct.Purchase(10);
    }
}
```

### Expected Output

```
Purchasing Physical Product...
Processing Credit Card Payment of $50
Purchasing Digital Product...
Processing PayPal Payment of $20
Purchasing Subscription Product...
Processing Crypto Payment of $10
```

## Benefits of Bridge Pattern

* **Flexibility:** Add new payment methods or product types without changing existing code.
* **Extensibility:** Supports unlimited variations without complex inheritance.
* **Clean Code:** Keeps payment logic separate from product logic.

## Common Mistakes

* Confusing Bridge Pattern with Adapter Pattern (Adapter makes two incompatible interfaces work together, Bridge separates abstraction and implementation).
* Creating unnecessary complexity without actual need for Bridge.

## Conclusion

The Bridge Pattern is an excellent choice when you need to decouple an abstraction from its implementation, making your code flexible and maintainable. By using Bridge in the Payment System example, you can add new payment methods or product types independently without changing existing code.





## 8. Composite Pattern

## Definition

* **Composite Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* It treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, allowing clients to work with them in the same way.

## When to Use

* When you need to represent part-whole hierarchies (tree structures).
* When you want to treat individual objects and their compositions uniformly.
* When building hierarchical structures like file systems, menus, or organizational charts.

## Key Components

* **Component:** Declares the interface for objects in the composition.
* **Leaf:** Represents individual objects that do not have children.
* **Composite:** Manages child components and can contain other composite or leaf objects.
* **Client:** Interacts with the component interface, treating all objects uniformly.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "File System." A folder can contain files (leaves) or other folders (composites). The client can treat both files and folders uniformly.

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Component Interface

```csharp
// Component - Defines the common interface
public interface IFileSystemItem
{
    void Display(int depth = 0);
}
```

### Step 2: Create Leaf (Individual Object)

```csharp
// Leaf - Represents a file
public class File : IFileSystemItem
{
    private readonly string _name;

    public File(string name)
    {
        _name = name;
    }

    public void Display(int depth = 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(new string('-', depth) + _name);
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Create Composite (Folder)

```csharp
// Composite - Represents a folder
public class Folder : IFileSystemItem
{
    private readonly string _name;
    private readonly List<IFileSystemItem> _items = new List<IFileSystemItem>();

    public Folder(string name)
    {
        _name = name;
    }

    public void AddItem(IFileSystemItem item)
    {
        _items.Add(item);
    }

    public void Display(int depth = 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(new string('-', depth) + _name);

        foreach (var item in _items)
        {
            item.Display(depth + 2);
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the Composite Pattern
var rootFolder = new Folder("Root");
var subFolder1 = new Folder("Documents");
var subFolder2 = new Folder("Pictures");

rootFolder.AddItem(new File("ReadMe.txt"));
subFolder1.AddItem(new File("Resume.pdf"));
subFolder1.AddItem(new File("Report.docx"));
subFolder2.AddItem(new File("Photo1.png"));
subFolder2.AddItem(new File("Photo2.jpg"));

rootFolder.AddItem(subFolder1);
rootFolder.AddItem(subFolder2);

rootFolder.Display();
```

### Output

```
-Root
--ReadMe.txt
--Documents
----Resume.pdf
----Report.docx
--Pictures
----Photo1.png
----Photo2.jpg
```

## Benefits

* Allows you to work with tree structures and hierarchies easily.
* Treats individual objects and their compositions uniformly.
* Simplifies client code by allowing uniform handling of both leaves and composites.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Decorator Pattern:** Adds responsibilities to an object dynamically.

## 9. Decorator Pattern

## Definition

* **Decorator Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows you to dynamically add new behaviors or responsibilities to an object without modifying its existing class.
* It is an alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## When to Use

* When you need to add features to an object without modifying its class.
* When you want to add responsibilities to an object at runtime.
* When subclassing is not feasible due to a large number of possible combinations.

## Key Components

* **Component:** Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them.
* **Concrete Component:** The base object that will be decorated.
* **Decorator:** An abstract class that implements the component interface and has a reference to a component.
* **Concrete Decorators:** Add specific behaviors or responsibilities to the component.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "Coffee Shop." You have a basic coffee (Component), and you can add various toppings (Decorators) like milk, sugar, whipped cream, or caramel.

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Component Interface

```csharp
// Component - Defines the base interface
public interface ICoffee
{
    string GetDescription();
    double GetCost();
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Concrete Component

```csharp
// Concrete Component - Basic Coffee
public class BasicCoffee : ICoffee
{
    public string GetDescription() => "Basic Coffee";

    public double GetCost() => 2.0;
}
```

### Step 3: Create the Decorator

```csharp
// Decorator - Base Decorator
public abstract class CoffeeDecorator : ICoffee
{
    protected ICoffee _coffee;

    protected CoffeeDecorator(ICoffee coffee)
    {
        _coffee = coffee;
    }

    public virtual string GetDescription() => _coffee.GetDescription();

    public virtual double GetCost() => _coffee.GetCost();
}
```

### Step 4: Create Concrete Decorators

```csharp
// Concrete Decorator - Milk
public class MilkDecorator : CoffeeDecorator
{
    public MilkDecorator(ICoffee coffee) : base(coffee) { }

    public override string GetDescription() => _coffee.GetDescription() + ", Milk";

    public override double GetCost() => _coffee.GetCost() + 0.5;
}

// Concrete Decorator - Sugar
public class SugarDecorator : CoffeeDecorator
{
    public SugarDecorator(ICoffee coffee) : base(coffee) { }

    public override string GetDescription() => _coffee.GetDescription() + ", Sugar";

    public override double GetCost() => _coffee.GetCost() + 0.2;
}
```

### Step 5: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the Decorator Pattern
ICoffee basicCoffee = new BasicCoffee();
Console.WriteLine($"Description: {basicCoffee.GetDescription()}, Cost: ${basicCoffee.GetCost()}");

// Add Milk
ICoffee milkCoffee = new MilkDecorator(basicCoffee);
Console.WriteLine($"Description: {milkCoffee.GetDescription()}, Cost: ${milkCoffee.GetCost()}");

// Add Sugar
ICoffee sweetMilkCoffee = new SugarDecorator(milkCoffee);
Console.WriteLine($"Description: {sweetMilkCoffee.GetDescription()}, Cost: ${sweetMilkCoffee.GetCost()}");
```

### Output

```
Description: Basic Coffee, Cost: $2.0
Description: Basic Coffee, Milk, Cost: $2.5
Description: Basic Coffee, Milk, Sugar, Cost: $2.7
```

## Benefits

* Allows flexible extension of object behavior without modifying existing code.
* Promotes the open/closed principle (open for extension, closed for modification).
* Allows you to combine multiple decorators dynamically.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Proxy Pattern:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.
* **Composite Pattern:** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

## Common Mistakes (Watchouts)

* Overusing the Decorator Pattern, leading to a complex, hard-to-read structure.
* Confusing the Decorator Pattern with Inheritance.

## Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Decorator Pattern, and why would you use it?**

   * The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to add new behaviors or responsibilities to an object dynamically without modifying its class. It is used to extend object functionality.

2. **How is the Decorator Pattern different from the Proxy Pattern?**

   * Decorator adds new behaviors to an object, while Proxy controls access to an object.

3. **What are the main components of the Decorator Pattern?**

   * Component, Concrete Component, Decorator, and Concrete Decorators.

4. **Can you provide a real-world example of the Decorator Pattern?**

   * A coffee shop where you can add toppings to a basic coffee, like milk, sugar, whipped cream.

5. **How would you extend the Decorator Pattern to add more toppings?**

## 10. Facade Pattern

## Definition

* **Facade Pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a complex subsystem.
* It hides the complexity of the subsystem by providing a simple interface for the client.

## When to Use

* When you want to simplify complex subsystems.
* When you want to provide a simple interface for a complex system with multiple classes.
* When you want to decouple clients from complex subsystem components.

## Key Components

* **Facade:** Provides a simple interface to the complex subsystem.
* **Subsystem Classes:** The complex classes that the facade interacts with.
* **Client:** Uses the facade to interact with the subsystem without knowing its complexity.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "Restaurant Menu." The customer (Client) can order food using the menu (Facade) without knowing how each dish is prepared in the kitchen (Subsystem).

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Create the Subsystem Classes

```csharp
// Subsystem Class - Order Processing
public class OrderProcessor
{
    public void ProcessOrder(string item)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing order for {item}");
    }
}

// Subsystem Class - Payment Gateway
public class PaymentProcessor
{
    public void ProcessPayment(double amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing payment of ${amount}");
    }
}

// Subsystem Class - Notification Service
public class NotificationService
{
    public void SendNotification(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sending notification: {message}");
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Facade

```csharp
// Facade - Simplified interface for the subsystem
public class OrderFacade
{
    private readonly OrderProcessor _orderProcessor = new OrderProcessor();
    private readonly PaymentProcessor _paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();
    private readonly NotificationService _notificationService = new NotificationService();

    public void PlaceOrder(string item, double amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting Order Process...");
        _orderProcessor.ProcessOrder(item);
        _paymentProcessor.ProcessPayment(amount);
        _notificationService.SendNotification($"Order for {item} has been placed.");
        Console.WriteLine("Order Process Complete.");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the Facade Pattern
var orderFacade = new OrderFacade();
orderFacade.PlaceOrder("Pizza", 15.99);
```

### Output

```
Starting Order Process...
Processing order for Pizza
Processing payment of $15.99
Sending notification: Order for Pizza has been placed.
Order Process Complete.
```

## Benefits

* Simplifies the use of a complex subsystem.
* Provides a clear and easy-to-use interface for clients.
* Decouples clients from the complex subsystem, promoting loose coupling.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Mediator Pattern:** Coordinates interactions between multiple objects without direct coupling.
* **Adapter Pattern:** Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.

## Common Mistakes (Watchouts)

* Overusing Facade for simple systems (overengineering).
* Directly exposing the subsystem classes without any simplification.

## Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Facade Pattern, and why would you use it?**

   * The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a unified and simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It is used to simplify complex systems.

2. **How is the Facade Pattern different from the Adapter Pattern?**

   * Facade simplifies a complex system by providing a unified interface, while Adapter converts one interface into another.

3. **What are the main components of the Facade Pattern?**

   * Facade, Subsystem Classes, and Client.

4. **Can you provide a real-world example of the Facade Pattern?**

   * A restaurant menu (Facade) that allows customers to order food without knowing how each dish is prepared (Subsystem).

5. **How would you extend the Facade Pattern to add more features?**

   * By adding more methods to the Facade class that combine subsystem functionality in different ways.


## 11. Flyweight Pattern

## Definition

* **Flyweight Pattern** is a structural design pattern that reduces memory usage by sharing common state among multiple objects.
* It optimizes resource usage by minimizing the number of objects created.

## When to Use

* When you need to create a large number of similar objects.
* When memory consumption is a concern.
* When most of the object data can be shared across multiple instances.

## Key Components

* **Flyweight Interface:** Declares methods for sharing intrinsic state.
* **Concrete Flyweight:** Implements the flyweight interface and shares intrinsic state.
* **Unshared Concrete Flyweight:** Objects that do not share state.
* **Flyweight Factory:** Manages the creation and reuse of flyweight objects.
* **Client:** Uses the flyweight objects via the factory.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "Text Editor" that displays repeated characters on the screen. Instead of creating a new object for each character, it uses the same object for each repeated character (like the letter 'A').

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Flyweight Interface

```csharp
// Flyweight Interface
public interface IShape
{
    void Draw(string color);
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Concrete Flyweight

```csharp
// Concrete Flyweight - Circle
public class Circle : IShape
{
    private readonly string _shapeType = "Circle";

    public void Draw(string color)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Drawing {_shapeType} with color {color}");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Create the Flyweight Factory

```csharp
// Flyweight Factory - Manages flyweight instances
public class ShapeFactory
{
    private static readonly Dictionary<string, IShape> _shapes = new();

    public static IShape GetShape(string shapeType)
    {
        if (!_shapes.ContainsKey(shapeType))
        {
            _shapes[shapeType] = new Circle();
            Console.WriteLine($"Creating new {shapeType} object.");
        }

        return _shapes[shapeType];
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the Flyweight Pattern
var circle1 = ShapeFactory.GetShape("Circle");
circle1.Draw("Red");

var circle2 = ShapeFactory.GetShape("Circle");
circle2.Draw("Green");

var circle3 = ShapeFactory.GetShape("Circle");
circle3.Draw("Blue");
```

### Output

```
Creating new Circle object.
Drawing Circle with color Red
Drawing Circle with color Green
Drawing Circle with color Blue
```

## Benefits

* Reduces memory usage by sharing objects.
* Increases efficiency when dealing with a large number of similar objects.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance.
* **Prototype Pattern:** Creates objects by copying an existing object (clone).

## Common Mistakes (Watchouts)

* Misusing Flyweight for objects with unique state (should only be used for shared state).
* Overcomplicating the Flyweight Factory with too many conditions.

## Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Flyweight Pattern, and why would you use it?**

   * The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern that reduces memory usage by sharing common state among multiple objects. It is used to optimize memory in large systems.

2. **How is the Flyweight Pattern different from the Singleton Pattern?**

   * Flyweight shares common state across multiple objects, while Singleton ensures only one instance of an object exists.

3. **What is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic state in Flyweight Pattern?**

   * Intrinsic state is shared and remains the same, while extrinsic state is passed externally and can vary.

4. **Can you provide a real-world example of the Flyweight Pattern?**

   * A text editor reusing character objects for frequently used letters like 'A' instead of creating a new object each time.

5. **How would you extend the Flyweight Pattern to support more shapes?**

   * By adding more shape classes (e.g., Square, Triangle) and handling them in the ShapeFactory.

## 12.  Proxy Pattern 

## 1. Definition

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is used to create an intermediary object that controls access to another object, often for purposes like access control, lazy initialization, logging, or caching.

## 2. When to Use

* When you want to control access to a resource-intensive object.
* When you need to add security or logging without modifying the original object.
* When you want to perform lazy initialization (create the object only when it is needed).
* When you want to control access to a remote object.

## 3. Key Components

* **Subject Interface:** Defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy.
* **RealSubject:** The actual object that the proxy represents.
* **Proxy:** The surrogate or placeholder object that controls access to the RealSubject.

## 4. Real-World Analogy

Imagine a security guard (Proxy) controlling access to a secure building (RealSubject). The guard checks the identity of people (access control) before letting them enter the building.

## 5. Full Code Example

```csharp
using System;

// Subject Interface
public interface IReportGenerator
{
    void GenerateReport();
}

// RealSubject
public class ReportGenerator : IReportGenerator
{
    public void GenerateReport()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Generating a complex report...");
    }
}

// Proxy
public class ReportGeneratorProxy : IReportGenerator
{
    private ReportGenerator _realReportGenerator;
    private bool _hasAccess;

    public ReportGeneratorProxy(bool hasAccess)
    {
        _hasAccess = hasAccess;
    }

    public void GenerateReport()
    {
        if (_hasAccess)
        {
            if (_realReportGenerator == null)
            {
                _realReportGenerator = new ReportGenerator();
            }
            _realReportGenerator.GenerateReport();
        }

    * Answer: Increased complexity, potential for misuse, and risk of violating the Single Responsibility Principle.


## 13. Chain of Responsibility Pattern 

## 1. Definition

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## 2. When to Use

* When you have multiple objects that can handle a request, but the handler should be determined at runtime.
* When you want to decouple sender and receiver of a request.
* When you want to avoid excessive if-else or switch-case conditions in your code.

## 3. Key Components

* **Handler (Abstract Class or Interface):** Declares a method to process a request and holds a reference to the next handler.
* **Concrete Handler:** Implements the handler interface and decides if it can process the request or pass it to the next handler.
* **Client:** Initiates the request and passes it to the chain of handlers.

## 4. Real-World Analogy

Imagine a customer support system with multiple support levels (Level 1, Level 2, and Manager). If Level 1 cannot handle a customer query, it forwards the request to Level 2, and so on, until the query is resolved.

## 5. Full Code Example

```csharp
using System;

// Handler Interface
public abstract class SupportHandler
{
    protected SupportHandler _nextHandler;

    public void SetNextHandler(SupportHandler nextHandler)
    {
        _nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }

    public abstract void HandleRequest(string request);
}

// Concrete Handler 1
public class LevelOneSupport : SupportHandler
{
    public override void HandleRequest(string request)
    {
        if (request == "Simple Query")
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Level 1 Support: Handled Simple Query.");
        }
        else if (_nextHandler != null)
        {
            _nextHandler.HandleRequest(request);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Request could not be handled.");
        }
    }
}

// Concrete Handler 2
public class LevelTwoSupport : SupportHandler
{
    public override void HandleRequest(string request)
    {
        if (request == "Intermediate Query")
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Level 2 Support: Handled Intermediate Query.");
        }
        else if (_nextHandler != null)
        {
            _nextHandler.HandleRequest(request);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Request could not be handled.");
        }
    }
}

// Concrete Handler 3
public class ManagerSupport : SupportHandler
{
    public override void HandleRequest(string request)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Manager Support: Handled any remaining query.");
    }
}

// Client Code
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        SupportHandler levelOne = new LevelOneSupport();
        SupportHandler levelTwo = new LevelTwoSupport();
        SupportHandler manager = new ManagerSupport();

        levelOne.SetNextHandler(levelTwo);
        levelTwo.SetNextHandler(manager);

        Console.WriteLine("--- Sending Simple Query ---");
        levelOne.HandleRequest("Simple Query");

        Console.WriteLine("--- Sending Intermediate Query ---");
        levelOne.HandleRequest("Intermediate Query");

        Console.WriteLine("--- Sending Complex Query ---");
        levelOne.HandleRequest("Complex Query");
    }
}
```

## 6. Benefits

    * Answer: Create the new handler and set it as the next handler for an existing handler in the chain.


## 14.  Command Pattern 

## 1. Definition

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all the information needed to perform an action. It decouples the sender of a request from the object that executes it.

## 2. When to Use

* When you want to parameterize objects with operations (e.g., undo/redo functionality).
* When you want to queue or log requests.
* When you want to support operations that can be executed, undone, or re-executed.

## 3. Key Components

* **Command Interface:** Declares the method for executing a command.
* **Concrete Command:** Implements the Command interface, holding the actual operation.
* **Invoker:** Holds and executes commands.
* **Receiver:** Performs the actual work when the command is executed.

## 4. Real-World Analogy

Think of a remote control (Invoker) that sends commands (Command) to a TV (Receiver). Each button press is a command that tells the TV what to do (like turning it on, changing the channel, etc.).

## 5. Full Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Command Interface
public interface ICommand
{
    void Execute();
}

// Receiver
public class Light
{
    public void TurnOn()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Light is ON.");
    }

    public void TurnOff()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Light is OFF.");
    }
}

        _light.TurnOn();
    }
}

// Concrete Command - Turn Off Command
public class TurnOffCommand : ICommand
{
    private Light _light;

    public TurnOffCommand(Light light)
    {
        _light = light;
    }

    public void Execute()
    {
        _light.TurnOff();
    }
}

// Invoker
public class RemoteControl
{
    private List<ICommand> _commands = new List<ICommand>();

    public void AddCommand(ICommand command)
    {
        _commands.Add(command);
    }

    public void ExecuteCommands()
    {
        foreach (var command in _commands)
        {
            command.Execute();
        }
    }
}

// Client Code
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Light livingRoomLight = new Light();

        ICommand turnOn = new TurnOnCommand(livingRoomLight);
        ICommand turnOff = new TurnOffCommand(livingRoomLight);

        RemoteControl remote = new RemoteControl();
        remote.AddCommand(turnOn);
        remote.AddCommand(turnOff);

        Console.WriteLine("--- Executing Commands ---");
        remote.ExecuteCommands();
    }
}

## 15. Interpreter Pattern in C\#

## 1. Definition

The Interpreter Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a representation of a language's grammar and uses an interpreter to evaluate sentences in that language. It is used to interpret and evaluate expressions within a specific domain.

## 2. When to Use

* When you need to evaluate language expressions or instructions.
* When you want to build a parser for a simple language or notation.
* When you need to interpret user-defined scripts, commands, or configuration files.

## 3. Key Components

* **Abstract Expression:** Declares the `Interpret` method for all expressions.
* **Terminal Expression:** Represents a simple, atomic expression in the language.
* **Non-Terminal Expression:** Represents a complex expression composed of other expressions.
* **Context:** Contains information that is global to the interpreter.

## 4. Real-World Analogy

Imagine a basic calculator that can parse and evaluate mathematical expressions like "3 + 5" or "10 - 2". Each number is a Terminal Expression, while operators like '+' or '-' are Non-Terminal Expressions that perform actions.

## 5. Full Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Abstract Expression
public interface IExpression
{
    int Interpret(Dictionary<string, int> context);
}

// Terminal Expression
public class NumberExpression : IExpression
{
    private int _number;

    public NumberExpression(int number)
    {
        _number = number;
    }

    public int Interpret(Dictionary<string, int> context)
    {
        return _number;
    }
}

// Non-Terminal Expression (Addition)
public class AdditionExpression : IExpression
{
    private IExpression _leftExpression;
    private IExpression _rightExpression;

    public AdditionExpression(IExpression left, IExpression right)
    {
        _leftExpression = left;
        _rightExpression = right;
    }

    public int Interpret(Dictionary<string, int> context)
    {
        return _leftExpression.Interpret(context) + _rightExpression.Interpret(context);
    }
}

// Non-Terminal Expression (Subtraction)
public class SubtractionExpression : IExpression
{
    private IExpression _leftExpression;
    private IExpression _rightExpression;

    public SubtractionExpression(IExpression left, IExpression right)
    {
        _leftExpression = left;
        _rightExpression = right;
    }

    public int Interpret(Dictionary<string, int> context)
    {
        return _leftExpression.Interpret(context) - _rightExpression.Interpret(context);
    }
}

// Client Code
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Context: no variables used
        Dictionary<string, int> context = new Dictionary<string, int>();

        // 5 + 3 - 2
        IExpression expression = new SubtractionExpression(
            new AdditionExpression(new NumberExpression(5), new NumberExpression(3)),
            new NumberExpression(2)
        );

        Console.WriteLine("Result: " + expression.Interpret(context));
    }
}
```

## 6. Benefits

* Simplifies the creation of a language parser.
* Makes it easy to extend the language by adding new expressions.
* Decouples the syntax of a language from its evaluation logic.

## 7. Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Composite Pattern:** Structures expressions in a tree-like form.
* **Strategy Pattern:** Defines interchangeable algorithms, similar to expressions.
* **Visitor Pattern:** Provides a way to add operations to complex objects without modifying them.

## 8. Common Mistakes

* Overusing the pattern for complex languages, making the structure hard to maintain.
* Creating too many classes for simple expressions.
* Confusing Terminal and Non-Terminal expressions.

    * Answer: You can add new expression types without modifying existing code.


## 16. Mediator Pattern

## Definition

The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that facilitates communication between multiple objects without them directly referencing each other. It promotes loose coupling by introducing a mediator object that controls communication between components.

## When to Use

* When you have a group of related objects that need to communicate, but you want to avoid direct connections between them.
* When adding or modifying communication between objects should not require changes in those objects.
* When you want to centralize complex interaction logic.

## Key Components

1. **Mediator Interface:** Defines the communication method.
2. **Concrete Mediator:** Implements the communication logic between components.
3. **Colleagues (Components):** The objects that communicate through the mediator.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine an Air Traffic Control (ATC) system at an airport. Each airplane (Colleague) does not communicate directly with other airplanes. Instead, all communication is handled by the ATC (Mediator), which coordinates landings, takeoffs, and air traffic.

## Full Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Mediator Interface
public interface IChatMediator
{
    void RegisterUser(User user);
    void SendMessage(string message, User sender);
}

// Concrete Mediator
public class ChatMediator : IChatMediator
{
    private readonly List<User> _users = new();

    public void RegisterUser(User user)
    {
        _users.Add(user);
        user.SetMediator(this);
    }

    public void SendMessage(string message, User sender)
    {
        foreach (var user in _users)
        {
            if (user != sender)
            {
                user.ReceiveMessage(message);
            }
        }
    }
}

// Colleague (User)
public abstract class User
{
    protected IChatMediator _mediator;
    public string Name { get; }

    public User(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }

    public void SetMediator(IChatMediator mediator)
    {
        _mediator = mediator;
    }

    public abstract void SendMessage(string message);
    public abstract void ReceiveMessage(string message);
}

// Concrete Colleague
public class ChatUser : User
{
    public ChatUser(string name) : base(name) { }

    public override void SendMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Name} sends: {message}");
        _mediator.SendMessage(message, this);
    }

    public override void ReceiveMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Name} receives: {message}");
    }
}

// Usage Example
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IChatMediator chatMediator = new ChatMediator();

        User user1 = new ChatUser("Alice");
        User user2 = new ChatUser("Bob");
        User user3 = new ChatUser("Charlie");

        chatMediator.RegisterUser(user1);
        chatMediator.RegisterUser(user2);
        chatMediator.RegisterUser(user3);

        user1.SendMessage("Hello, everyone!");
    }
}
```

10. **What are some similar patterns to the Mediator Pattern?**

* Observer, Command, Facade.


## 17. Memento Design Pattern 

## Definition

The Memento Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to capture and save the state of an object without exposing its implementation details, and then restore that state later.

## When to Use

* When you need to save and restore the state of an object.
* When direct access to the state is not allowed (encapsulation).
* When implementing undo/redo functionality in an application.

## Key Components

1. **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved.
2. **Memento**: A representation of the saved state (a snapshot).
3. **Caretaker**: Manages the saving and restoring of mementos without modifying the memento's state.

## Real-World Analogy

Think of a video game save system. When you save your progress (Memento), you create a snapshot of your character's stats, inventory, and location (Originator). The game manages the save files (Caretaker), allowing you to restore them when needed.

## Full Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Originator
class Document
{
    public string Content { get; set; }

    public DocumentMemento Save() => new DocumentMemento(Content);

    public void Restore(DocumentMemento memento)
    {
        Content = memento.Content;
    }
}

// Memento
class DocumentMemento
{
    public string Content { get; }

    public DocumentMemento(string content)
    {
        Content = content;
    }
}

// Caretaker
class DocumentHistory
{
    private Stack<DocumentMemento> _history = new Stack<DocumentMemento>();

    public void Save(Document document)
    {
        _history.Push(document.Save());
    }

    public void Undo(Document document)
    {
        if (_history.Count > 0)
        {
            document.Restore(_history.Pop());
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("No more undo available.");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Document doc = new Document();
        DocumentHistory history = new DocumentHistory();

        doc.Content = "Version 1";
        history.Save(doc);

        doc.Content = "Version 2";
        history.Save(doc);

        doc.Content = "Version 3";
        Console.WriteLine("Current Content: " + doc.Content);

        history.Undo(doc);
        Console.WriteLine("After Undo: " + doc.Content);

        history.Undo(doc);
        Console.WriteLine("After Another Undo: " + doc.Content);
    }
}
```

## Benefits

* Provides an undo/redo mechanism.
* Encapsulates state-saving logic within the Originator.
* Prevents direct access to the state of the Originator.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* Command Pattern (For executing and undoing commands).
* Prototype Pattern (For cloning objects).
* Snapshot Pattern (For state management).

## Common Mistakes

* Exposing the state of the Memento, violating encapsulation.
* Making the Memento mutable.
* Not properly managing the history in the Caretaker.

## 10 Interview Questions with Detailed Answers

1. **What is the Memento Design Pattern?**

   * Answer: It is a behavioral design pattern that captures and saves an object's state without exposing its implementation details.

2. **What are the three main components of the Memento Pattern?**

   * Answer: Originator, Memento, and Caretaker.

3. **How does the Memento Pattern ensure encapsulation?**

   * Answer: By making the Memento a separate class that only the Originator can directly access.

4. **When should you use the Memento Pattern?**

   * Answer: When you need to save and restore the state of an object, such as implementing an undo/redo feature.

5. **What is the role of the Caretaker?**

   * Answer: It manages the saved mementos and decides when to save or restore them without modifying their state.

6. **What is the difference between Memento and Prototype Pattern?**

   * Answer: Memento saves an object's state for restoration, while Prototype creates a copy of an object.

7. **Can Memento be used with multiple state variables?**

   * Answer: Yes, the Memento can store multiple state variables, but it should maintain encapsulation.

8. **How does the Caretaker ensure the correct state is restored?**

   * Answer: It stores and manages a history of mementos, allowing step-by-step restoration.

9. **What are the common mistakes with the Memento Pattern?**

   * Answer: Exposing the state of the Memento and making it mutable.

10. **Can Memento Pattern be used for complex objects?**

* Answer: Yes, but it should be carefully designed to avoid excessive memory usage.


## 18. Observer Pattern

## Definition

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes its state, all its dependent objects (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

## When to Use

* When an object should automatically notify multiple dependent objects about any state changes.
* When you have a publisher/subscriber scenario, where subscribers depend on the state of the publisher.
* Ideal for implementing event handling systems or real-time notifications.

## Key Components

1. **Subject (Publisher)**: The object that holds the state and notifies observers.
2. **Observer (Subscriber)**: Objects that receive notifications from the subject.
3. **ConcreteSubject**: A specific implementation of the subject that stores the state.
4. **ConcreteObserver**: A specific implementation of the observer that receives updates.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a news agency (Subject) that publishes news updates. Subscribers (Observers) can register to receive notifications. When news is published, all registered subscribers automatically receive the update.

## Full Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Subject Interface
public interface ISubject {
    void Attach(IObserver observer);
    void Detach(IObserver observer);
    void Notify();
}

// Concrete Subject
public class NewsAgency : ISubject {
    private List<IObserver> _observers = new List<IObserver>();
    private string _news;

    public string News {
        get => _news;
        set {
            _news = value;
            Notify();
        }
    }

    public void Attach(IObserver observer) => _observers.Add(observer);
    public void Detach(IObserver observer) => _observers.Remove(observer);

    public void Notify() {
        foreach (var observer in _observers) {
            observer.Update(_news);
        }
    }
}

// Observer Interface
public interface IObserver {
    void Update(string news);
}

// Concrete Observer
public class Subscriber : IObserver {
    private string _name;

    public Subscriber(string name) => _name = name;

    public void Update(string news) {
        Console.WriteLine($"{_name} received news update: {news}");
    }
}

// Usage
class Program {
    static void Main() {
        var agency = new NewsAgency();

        var sub1 = new Subscriber("Alice");
        var sub2 = new Subscriber("Bob");

        agency.Attach(sub1);
        agency.Attach(sub2);

        agency.News = "Breaking News: New technology released!";

        agency.Detach(sub1);

        agency.News = "Update: Technology is trending now.";
    }
}
```

## Benefits

* Decouples subjects from observers, making the system flexible and scalable.
* Provides a push-based notification mechanism.
* Easy to add/remove observers without affecting the subject.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* Mediator Pattern
* Event Aggregator Pattern
* Publisher-Subscriber Pattern

## Common Mistakes

* Overusing the pattern for simple scenarios where direct method calls are more efficient.
* Failing to manage observer lifecycle, leading to memory leaks.
* Not considering thread safety in multi-threaded scenarios.

## 10 Interview Questions with Detailed Answers

1. **What is the Observer Pattern?**

* The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object (subject) notifies a list of dependent objects (observers) of any state changes.

2. **When should you use the Observer Pattern?**

* When you have a one-to-many dependency, such as event handling or notification systems.

3. **What are the key components of the Observer Pattern?**

* Subject, Observer, ConcreteSubject, and ConcreteObserver.

4. **How does the Observer Pattern differ from the Mediator Pattern?**

* Observer has a direct dependency between the subject and observers, while Mediator handles communication through a central mediator.

5. **How do you avoid memory leaks in Observer Pattern?**

* Use weak references or ensure that observers are properly detached when no longer needed.

6. **Can the Observer Pattern be implemented using Events in C#?**

* Yes, the .NET EventHandler is a built-in implementation of the Observer Pattern.

7. **How does the Observer Pattern support decoupling?**

* Observers are unaware of the subject’s internal state and only rely on updates through an interface.

8. **What is the difference between push and pull in Observer Pattern?**

* Push: Subject sends state data directly to observers. Pull: Observers request state from the subject.

9. **How can you make the Observer Pattern thread-safe?**

* Use thread-safe collections for observer storage and implement locking during notifications.

10. **What are some real-world use cases of the Observer Pattern?**

* Event systems, logging frameworks, data binding in UI frameworks (like WPF, Blazor), and notification systems.


## 19. State Pattern

## Definition

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates state-specific behavior in separate classes and delegates state management to these classes.

## When to Use

* When an object’s behavior is dependent on its state and needs to change dynamically at runtime.
* When you have complex conditional state transitions (if/else or switch statements) scattered across multiple methods.
* When you want to make state transitions explicit and easily maintainable.

## Key Components

1. **Context**: The main object whose behavior changes depending on its state.
2. **State (Interface or Abstract Class)**: Defines the interface for behavior associated with each state.
3. **Concrete State Classes**: Implement behavior for each state.

## Real-World Analogy

Think of a vending machine. A vending machine has different states: Ready, Out of Stock, Processing Payment, and Dispensing Product. Depending on the current state, the machine behaves differently when a user interacts with it.

## Full Code Example

```csharp
// State Interface
public interface IState
{
    void InsertCoin();
    void DispenseProduct();
}

// Concrete States
public class ReadyState : IState
{
    private VendingMachine _vendingMachine;

    public ReadyState(VendingMachine vendingMachine)
    {
        _vendingMachine = vendingMachine;
    }

    public void InsertCoin()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Coin Inserted. Switching to Processing State.");
        _vendingMachine.SetState(_vendingMachine.ProcessingState);
    }

    public void DispenseProduct()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Cannot dispense. Please insert coin first.");
    }
}

public class ProcessingState : IState
{
    private VendingMachine _vendingMachine;

    public ProcessingState(VendingMachine vendingMachine)
    {
        _vendingMachine = vendingMachine;
    }

    public void InsertCoin()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Already processing. Please wait.");
    }

    public void DispenseProduct()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dispensing product.");
        _vendingMachine.SetState(_vendingMachine.ReadyState);
    }
}

// Context
public class VendingMachine
{
    public IState ReadyState { get; }
    public IState ProcessingState { get; }

    private IState _currentState;

    public VendingMachine()
    {
        ReadyState = new ReadyState(this);
        ProcessingState = new ProcessingState(this);
        _currentState = ReadyState;
    }

    public void SetState(IState state)
    {
        _currentState = state;
    }

    public void InsertCoin()
    {
        _currentState.InsertCoin();
    }

    public void DispenseProduct()
    {
        _currentState.DispenseProduct();
    }
}

// Usage
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        VendingMachine vendingMachine = new VendingMachine();

        vendingMachine.InsertCoin();
        vendingMachine.DispenseProduct();

        vendingMachine.InsertCoin();
        vendingMachine.InsertCoin();
    }
}
```

## Benefits

* Simplifies complex conditional state transitions.
* Makes the code more maintainable and readable.
* Each state behavior is isolated in its own class, following Single Responsibility Principle.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* Strategy Pattern: Focuses on interchangeable algorithms.
* Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object.
* Template Method Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class.

## Common Mistakes

* Overcomplicating the design by creating too many state classes for simple problems.
* Not making state transitions explicit.
* Using if/else conditions within the state classes, which defeats the purpose of the pattern.

## 10 Interview Questions with Detailed Answers

1. **What is the State Pattern, and how does it differ from Strategy Pattern?**

   * The State Pattern focuses on changing behavior based on the object's internal state, while the Strategy Pattern focuses on interchangeable algorithms without changing the object's state.

2. **When should you prefer using the State Pattern over a simple switch statement?**

   * When your object has multiple complex state-dependent behaviors that would make a switch statement difficult to maintain.

3. **Explain how the State Pattern adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.**

   * The State Pattern allows adding new states without modifying existing code, making it open for extension but closed for modification.

4. **How can the State Pattern help avoid duplicate code?**

   * By isolating state-specific behavior in separate classes, it prevents duplicate condition checks scattered across the context.

5. **What is the role of the Context class in the State Pattern?**

   * It maintains a reference to the current state and delegates state-specific behavior to it.

6. **Can the State Pattern work without an interface for states? Why or why not?**

   * While it can work without an interface, using an interface ensures a common structure for all state classes.

7. **How do you handle transitions between states in the State Pattern?**

   * The context class is responsible for changing the current state.

8. **What are the benefits of isolating state logic in separate classes?**

   * It enhances code readability, maintainability, and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.

9. **How would you refactor a class with multiple conditional statements using the State Pattern?**

   * Extract state-specific behaviors into separate state classes and use a context class to manage them.

10. **What is the impact of the State Pattern on unit testing?**

* State-specific behavior can be tested independently, making testing easier and more focused.


## 20. Strategy Pattern

## Definition

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to be selected at runtime.

## When to Use

* When you want to define multiple algorithms for a specific task but need to switch between them dynamically.
* When your application needs to choose between different behaviors without modifying the client code.
* When you want to separate the algorithm’s implementation from the client code.

## Key Components

1. **Strategy Interface**: Defines the algorithm or operation that can be performed.
2. **Concrete Strategies**: Implement the strategy interface with different algorithms.
3. **Context**: Holds a reference to a strategy object and allows switching strategies dynamically.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a payment system for an online store. Depending on the customer's choice, they can pay using Credit Card, PayPal, or Bitcoin. Each of these payment methods can be considered a separate strategy, but they share a common interface for processing payments.

## Full Code Example

```csharp
// Strategy Interface
public interface IPaymentStrategy
{
    void Pay(decimal amount);
}

// Concrete Strategies
public class CreditCardPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Paid {amount} using Credit Card.");
    }
}

public class PayPalPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Paid {amount} using PayPal.");
    }
}

public class BitcoinPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Paid {amount} using Bitcoin.");
    }
}

// Context
public class PaymentContext
{
    private IPaymentStrategy _paymentStrategy;

    public void SetPaymentStrategy(IPaymentStrategy paymentStrategy)
    {
        _paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void ProcessPayment(decimal amount)
    {
        if (_paymentStrategy == null)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Payment strategy not set.");

        _paymentStrategy.Pay(amount);
    }
}

// Usage
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        PaymentContext context = new PaymentContext();

        context.SetPaymentStrategy(new CreditCardPayment());
        context.ProcessPayment(100);

        context.SetPaymentStrategy(new PayPalPayment());
        context.ProcessPayment(200);

        context.SetPaymentStrategy(new BitcoinPayment());
        context.ProcessPayment(300);
    }
}
```

## Benefits

* Allows switching between algorithms at runtime.
* Follows the Open/Closed Principle (new strategies can be added without modifying existing code).
* Decouples the algorithm from the context, making it more flexible.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* State Pattern

   * By defining a general strategy interface and allowing multiple implementations.

6. **How does Strategy Pattern support the Open/Closed Principle?**

   * New strategies can be added without modifying the context or existing strategies.

7. **Is it necessary to use interfaces for the Strategy Pattern?**

   * It is best practice, but abstract classes can also be used.

8. **Can you implement Strategy Pattern without a Context class?**

   * Yes, but the context centralizes the strategy selection, making it more organized.

9. **What are the common mistakes in using Strategy Pattern?**

   * Not making the strategy interface flexible, creating tight coupling.

10. **How do you switch between strategies at runtime?**

* By setting a different strategy in the context using a method like `SetPaymentStrategy()`.


## 21. Template Method Pattern

## Definition

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but allows subclasses to override specific steps without changing the overall structure.

## When to Use

* When you have a common process with specific steps that may vary in subclasses.
* When you want to enforce a consistent algorithm structure but allow customization for certain steps.
* When you need code reusability across different but similar tasks.

## Key Components

1. **Abstract Class**: Defines the skeleton of the algorithm with one or more abstract methods that subclasses must implement.
2. **Concrete Subclasses**: Implement the abstract methods to provide specific behavior.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a restaurant cooking process. The general steps for preparing a dish (preparing ingredients, cooking, and serving) are the same. However, each dish has specific ingredients and cooking methods that vary. The restaurant defines the general cooking process (template), but chefs (subclasses) customize the details for each dish.

## Full Code Example

```csharp
// Abstract Class - Template
public abstract class MealPreparation
{
    // Template Method
    public void PrepareMeal()
    {
        PrepareIngredients();
        Cook();
        Serve();
    }

    protected abstract void PrepareIngredients();
    protected abstract void Cook();

    protected virtual void Serve()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Serving the dish.");
    }
}

// Concrete Subclass - Pasta
public class PastaMeal : MealPreparation
{
    protected override void PrepareIngredients()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Preparing pasta, sauce, and spices.");
    }

    protected override void Cook()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Cooking pasta and mixing with sauce.");
    }
}

// Concrete Subclass - Salad
public class SaladMeal : MealPreparation
{
    protected override void PrepareIngredients()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Chopping vegetables and preparing dressing.");
    }

    protected override void Cook()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Mixing vegetables with dressing.");
    }
}

// Usage
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        MealPreparation pasta = new PastaMeal();
        pasta.PrepareMeal();

        MealPreparation salad = new SaladMeal();
        salad.PrepareMeal();
    }
}
```

## Benefits

* Promotes code reusability by defining a general structure in the base class.
* Allows subclasses to customize specific steps of the process.
* Follows the Open/Closed Principle (subclasses can extend without modifying base class).

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* Strategy Pattern
* Factory Method Pattern
* Command Pattern

## Common Mistakes

* Overusing the Template Method Pattern when the algorithm steps do not have a consistent structure.
* Making too many steps abstract, leading to code duplication in subclasses.
* Not making base class methods properly protected (instead of public).

## 10 Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Template Method Pattern in C#?**

   * It is a behavioral design pattern that defines a template (skeleton) of an algorithm in an abstract class and allows subclasses to implement specific steps.

2. **How does Template Method differ from Strategy Pattern?**

   * Template Method provides a fixed structure with customizable steps, while Strategy allows full algorithm swapping.

3. **What are the key components of the Template Method Pattern?**

   * Abstract Class (Template) and Concrete Subclasses.

4. **Can the Template Method Pattern be implemented without abstract classes?**

   * No, it requires an abstract base class to define the general structure.

5. **What is the role of a `virtual` method in Template Method Pattern?**

   * It allows a default implementation that can be overridden in subclasses.

6. **How does Template Method promote code reuse?**

   * By defining the algorithm’s structure in one place (base class) and allowing customization in subclasses.

7. **Can you make the Template Method private?**

   * No, it should be public or protected to allow external usage.

8. **What is a hook method in Template Method Pattern?**

   * A hook is a method with a default (usually empty) implementation that subclasses can optionally override.

9. **Is Template Method a behavioral design pattern? Why?**

   * Yes, because it defines the behavior of an algorithm with a consistent structure.

10. **What are the common mistakes in implementing Template Method Pattern?**

* Making the template method public instead of protected, or making too many methods abstract without default behavior.


## 22. Visitor Pattern

## Definition

The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new behaviors to existing classes without modifying them. It achieves this by separating the behavior into a separate visitor object that can be applied to the target classes.

## When to Use

* When you need to add new operations to a class hierarchy without modifying the existing classes.
* When you want to separate the logic for performing operations from the object structure.
* When you have a complex object structure with many related classes and you want to perform operations on them without altering their definitions.

## Key Components

1. **Visitor Interface**: Defines a visit method for each type of concrete element.
2. **Concrete Visitor**: Implements the visit methods for specific operations.
3. **Element Interface**: Declares an accept method that takes a visitor.
4. **Concrete Elements**: Implement the accept method, passing themselves to the visitor.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a museum where a guide can provide different types of information to different visitors (children, adults, researchers). The guide has a different approach for each type of visitor, but the museum exhibits themselves do not change.

## Full Code Example

```csharp
// Visitor Interface
public interface IVisitor
{
    void Visit(Book book);
    void Visit(Magazine magazine);
}

// Concrete Visitor
public class PriceCalculatorVisitor : IVisitor
{
    public void Visit(Book book)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Book: {book.Title}, Price: {book.Price * 0.9}");
    }

    public void Visit(Magazine magazine)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Magazine: {magazine.Title}, Price: {magazine.Price * 0.8}");
    }
}

// Element Interface
public interface IVisitable
{
    void Accept(IVisitor visitor);
}

// Concrete Elements
public class Book : IVisitable
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public double Price { get; set; }

    public void Accept(IVisitor visitor)
    {
        visitor.Visit(this);
    }
}

public class Magazine : IVisitable
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public double Price { get; set; }

    public void Accept(IVisitor visitor)
    {
        visitor.Visit(this);
    }
}

// Usage
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<IVisitable> items = new List<IVisitable>
        {
            new Book { Title = "C# Mastery", Price = 30 },
            new Magazine { Title = "Tech World", Price = 15 }
        };

        IVisitor priceCalculator = new PriceCalculatorVisitor();

        foreach (var item in items)
        {
            item.Accept(priceCalculator);
        }
    }
}
```

## Benefits

* Follows the Open/Closed Principle, allowing new operations without modifying existing classes.

   * Tight coupling between visitor and concrete elements, and not maintaining the visitor interface.

10. **Can the Visitor Pattern be used with unrelated classes?**

* Yes, but it is most effective with a well-defined object hierarchy.


## 23. Iterator Pattern

## Definition

The Iterator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.

## When to Use

* When you need to traverse a collection without exposing its internal structure.
* When you have different types of collections and want a uniform way to traverse them.
* When you want to provide multiple traversal options (forward, backward, filtered, etc.).

## Key Components

1. **Iterator Interface**: Defines the methods for accessing the elements in the collection.
2. **Concrete Iterator**: Implements the iterator interface for a specific collection.
3. **Aggregate Interface (Collection)**: Declares a method to create an iterator.
4. **Concrete Aggregate (Concrete Collection)**: Implements the aggregate interface and returns a concrete iterator.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a playlist in a music player. The playlist is a collection of songs, and the user can navigate through the songs sequentially (next, previous). The iterator here is the navigation control, which allows the user to access the songs without directly modifying the playlist.

## Full Code Example

```csharp
// Iterator Interface
public interface IIterator<T>
{
    bool HasNext();
    T Next();
}

// Concrete Iterator
public class BookIterator : IIterator<string>
{
    private readonly List<string> _books;
    private int _position = 0;

    public BookIterator(List<string> books)
    {
        _books = books;
    }

    public bool HasNext()
    {
        return _position < _books.Count;
    }

    public string Next()
    {
        return HasNext() ? _books[_position++] : null;
    }
}

// Aggregate Interface
public interface IBookCollection
{
    IIterator<string> CreateIterator();
}

// Concrete Aggregate
public class BookCollection : IBookCollection
{
    private List<string> _books = new List<string>();

    public void AddBook(string book)
    {
        _books.Add(book);
    }

    public IIterator<string> CreateIterator()
    {
        return new BookIterator(_books);
    }
}

// Usage
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        BookCollection bookCollection = new BookCollection();
        bookCollection.AddBook("C# Mastery");
        bookCollection.AddBook("Design Patterns in C#");
        bookCollection.AddBook("Advanced .NET Programming");

        IIterator<string> iterator = bookCollection.CreateIterator();

        while (iterator.HasNext())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(iterator.Next());
        }
    }
}
```

## Benefits

* Provides a consistent way to traverse different types of collections.
* Allows multiple iterators for the same collection (e.g., forward, backward).
* Encapsulates the traversal logic outside of the collection class.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* Composite Pattern
* Visitor Pattern
* Strategy Pattern

## Common Mistakes

* Exposing the internal structure of the collection directly.
* Not properly resetting the iterator position for a new iteration.
* Creating multiple iterators without understanding their independent state.

8. **What is a Concrete Iterator?**

   * It is a specific implementation of the iterator interface for a particular collection.

9. **What is the advantage of using an Iterator Pattern over a for loop?**

   * The iterator can abstract the traversal logic, making it flexible and decoupled from the collection.

10. **How do you reset an iterator to the starting position?**

* Typically by re-instantiating the iterator or providing a Reset method.

## 25. Null Object Pattern

## Definition

The Null Object Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a default object as a substitute for a null reference. This object can be used without requiring special handling for null values, avoiding null checks throughout the code.

## When to Use

* When you want to avoid frequent null checks in your code.
* When a default or do-nothing behavior makes sense for an absent object.
* When you want a clean, consistent way to handle missing or absent data.

## Key Components

1. **Abstract Base Class or Interface**: Defines the expected behavior for the object.
2. **Concrete Implementation**: Implements the base class or interface with actual behavior.
3. **Null Object**: A specific implementation of the base class that provides default or do-nothing behavior.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a customer support system where a customer can either be a registered customer with detailed information or a guest. If a customer record is not found, instead of returning null, a "GuestCustomer" object is returned, providing a default behavior.

## Full Code Example

```csharp
// Customer Interface
public interface ICustomer
{
    string GetCustomerDetails();
}

// Real Customer Class
public class RealCustomer : ICustomer
{
    private string _name;

    public RealCustomer(string name)
    {
        _name = name;
    }

    public string GetCustomerDetails()
    {
        return $"Customer Name: {_name}";
    }
}

// Null Customer Class (Null Object)
public class NullCustomer : ICustomer
{
    public string GetCustomerDetails()
    {
        return "Guest Customer - No Details Available";
    }
}

// Customer Factory
public class CustomerFactory
{
    private static readonly List<string> registeredCustomers = new List<string> { "John", "Jane", "Alice" };

    public static ICustomer GetCustomer(string name)
    {
        if (registeredCustomers.Contains(name))
        {
            return new RealCustomer(name);
        }
        return new NullCustomer();
    }
}

// Usage
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        ICustomer customer1 = CustomerFactory.GetCustomer("John");
        ICustomer customer2 = CustomerFactory.GetCustomer("David");

        Console.WriteLine(customer1.GetCustomerDetails()); // Output: Customer Name: John
        Console.WriteLine(customer2.GetCustomerDetails()); // Output: Guest Customer - No Details Available
    }
}
```

## Benefits

* Eliminates the need for frequent null checks.
* Provides a default behavior without altering the main logic.
* Follows the Open/Closed Principle (new null objects can be added without modifying existing code).

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* Strategy Pattern
* State Pattern
* Factory Pattern

## Common Mistakes

* Creating a complex null object with too many behaviors.
* Forgetting to use the null object consistently, leading to null reference exceptions.
* Not making the null object conform to the same interface as the real objects.

## 10 Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Null Object Pattern in C#?**

   * It is a behavioral design pattern that uses a default object as a substitute for a null reference, avoiding null checks in code.

2. **How does the Null Object Pattern differ from a simple null check?**

   * It provides a default object with predefined behavior instead of just checking for null.

3. **What are the key components of the Null Object Pattern?**

   * An interface or abstract base class, a concrete implementation, and a null object implementation.

4. **Can the Null Object Pattern be used with value types?**

   * No, it is primarily used with reference types.

5. **What are the advantages of using the Null Object Pattern?**

   * It simplifies code by avoiding null checks and provides consistent behavior.

6. **Can you have multiple Null Objects for a single interface?**

   * Yes, as long as they provide different default behaviors.

7. **How does the Null Object Pattern follow the Open/Closed Principle?**

   * New null objects can be added without modifying existing code.

8. **What is the difference between Null Object Pattern and Default Object Pattern?**

   * Null Object provides do-nothing behavior, while Default Object provides meaningful default behavior.

9. **When should you avoid using the Null Object Pattern?**

   * When the default behavior is complex or misleading.

10. **How do you test a Null Object implementation?**

* By asserting that it provides the expected default behavior without any exceptions.


## 29. Object Pool Pattern

## Definition

The Object Pool Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the reuse of objects that are expensive to create, instead of creating and destroying them repeatedly. It maintains a pool of reusable objects, minimizing the overhead of object creation and destruction.

## When to Use

* When object creation is expensive in terms of time or resources.
* When you want to manage the number of active objects in an application.
* When the objects can be reused without significant modification.

## Key Components

1. **Object Pool**: Manages the pool of reusable objects, providing access and tracking which objects are in use.
2. **Reusable Object**: The object type that will be managed in the pool.
3. **Client**: The code that requests an object from the pool, uses it, and returns it.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a car rental service. Instead of buying a new car every time a customer arrives, the service has a pool of cars. Customers can rent (acquire) a car from the pool, use it, and return it. The car is then cleaned and prepared for the next customer (reset).

## Full Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Reusable Object
public class DatabaseConnection
{
    public int Id { get; private set; }

    public DatabaseConnection(int id)
    {
        Id = id;
    }

    public void Connect()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"DatabaseConnection {Id} connected.");
    }

    public void Disconnect()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"DatabaseConnection {Id} disconnected.");
    }
}

// Object Pool
public class ConnectionPool
{
    private readonly List<DatabaseConnection> _availableConnections = new List<DatabaseConnection>();
    private readonly List<DatabaseConnection> _usedConnections = new List<DatabaseConnection>();
    private readonly int _maxConnections = 5;

    public ConnectionPool()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < _maxConnections; i++)
        {
            _availableConnections.Add(new DatabaseConnection(i + 1));
        }
    }

    public DatabaseConnection Acquire()
    {
        if (_availableConnections.Count > 0)
        {
            var connection = _availableConnections[0];
            _usedConnections.Add(connection);
            _availableConnections.RemoveAt(0);
            connection.Connect();
            return connection;
        }

        throw new InvalidOperationException("No available connections.");
    }

    public void Release(DatabaseConnection connection)
    {
        if (_usedConnections.Remove(connection))
        {
            connection.Disconnect();
            _availableConnections.Add(connection);
        }
    }
}

// Usage
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        ConnectionPool pool = new ConnectionPool();

        var conn1 = pool.Acquire();
        var conn2 = pool.Acquire();

        pool.Release(conn1);
        pool.Release(conn2);

        var conn3 = pool.Acquire(); // Reuses released connection
    }
}
```

## Benefits

* Reduces the cost of object creation and destruction.
* Controls the number of active objects, which is useful for resource management.
* Improves performance for high-frequency operations.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* Singleton Pattern
* Factory Pattern
* Flyweight Pattern

## Common Mistakes

* Not properly managing the pool, leading to memory leaks (objects not released).
* Allowing objects in the pool to maintain state between uses, causing unexpected behavior.
* Creating too many objects in the pool, leading to memory overhead.

## 10 Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Object Pool Pattern in C#?**

   * It is a creational design pattern that maintains a pool of reusable objects, avoiding the overhead of object creation and destruction.

2. **How does Object Pool Pattern differ from Singleton Pattern?**

   * By using thread-safe collections like `ConcurrentBag` or using lock mechanisms.

7. **What is the difference between Object Pool and Flyweight Pattern?**

   * Object Pool reuses complete objects, while Flyweight shares parts of an object’s state among many objects.

8. **What is the main disadvantage of using Object Pool Pattern?**

   * Memory overhead if the pool size is too large, and potential memory leaks if objects are not released.

9. **How do you initialize an Object Pool with a specific size?**

   * By creating a predefined number of objects in the pool during initialization.

10. **Can the Object Pool Pattern be used with asynchronous operations?**

* Yes, but you must ensure thread safety with synchronization methods (like `SemaphoreSlim`).

## 30. Lazy Initialization Pattern

# Lazy Initialization Pattern in C# - Master Guide

## Definition

The Lazy Initialization Pattern is a creational design pattern that defers the creation of an object until it is actually needed. This helps optimize performance by avoiding the creation of resource-intensive objects unless they are used.

## When to Use

* When object creation is expensive (in terms of time or memory) and may not always be needed.
* When you want to optimize resource usage in an application.
* When you want to delay expensive calculations or object creation until the value is actually required.

## Key Components

1. **Lazy Object or Value**: The object or value that is initialized only when it is accessed.
2. **Lazy Wrapper**: A mechanism (such as `Lazy<T>`) that defers the object creation.
3. **Thread-Safe Initialization**: Ensures that the object is created only once, even in multithreaded scenarios.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a hotel room that is not prepared until a guest checks in. This saves resources because empty rooms do not need to be cleaned or maintained until they are used.

## Full Code Example

```csharp
using System;

// Class representing an expensive resource
public class ExpensiveResource
{
    public ExpensiveResource()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Expensive Resource Created.");
    }

    public void UseResource()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Resource in use.");
    }
}

// Usage with Lazy Initialization
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Lazy initialization using Lazy<T>
        Lazy<ExpensiveResource> lazyResource = new Lazy<ExpensiveResource>();

        Console.WriteLine("Program started.");

        // Resource is only created when accessed
        lazyResource.Value.UseResource();

        // Resource is not created again
        lazyResource.Value.UseResource();
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Program started.
Expensive Resource Created.
Resource in use.
Resource in use.
```

## Benefits

* Delays the creation of objects until they are actually needed.
* Optimizes resource usage, improving application performance.
* Provides thread-safe lazy initialization using `Lazy<T>` in C#.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* Singleton Pattern (can use Lazy Initialization)
* Factory Pattern
* Object Pool Pattern

## Common Mistakes

* Using Lazy Initialization for objects that are always needed, leading to unnecessary complexity.
* Forgetting to use `Lazy<T>` with thread safety (`LazyThreadSafetyMode` for advanced scenarios).
* Misunderstanding that Lazy Initialization is not suitable for all scenarios (e.g., if initialization always occurs).

## 10 Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Lazy Initialization Pattern in C#?**

   * It is a creational pattern that delays the creation of an object until it is actually needed.

2. **How does Lazy Initialization differ from Eager Initialization?**

   * Lazy Initialization creates the object only when accessed, while Eager Initialization creates it immediately.

3. **How is Lazy Initialization implemented in C#?**

   * Using the `Lazy<T>` class in the .NET framework.

4. **What are the benefits of using Lazy Initialization?**

   * Reduced memory usage, improved performance, and deferred object creation.

5. **Can Lazy Initialization be used in a multithreaded environment?**

   * Yes, using `Lazy<T>` with thread-safe modes like `LazyThreadSafetyMode.ExecutionAndPublication`.

6. **How do you forcefully initialize a lazy object?**

   * By accessing the `Value` property of the `Lazy<T>` instance.

7. **What are the thread safety modes available for Lazy Initialization in C#?**

   * `LazyThreadSafetyMode.None`, `LazyThreadSafetyMode.PublicationOnly`, and `LazyThreadSafetyMode.ExecutionAndPublication`.

8. **What is the difference between Lazy Initialization and Object Pool Pattern?**

   * Lazy Initialization delays creation, while Object Pool reuses a set of pre-created objects.

9. **When should you avoid using Lazy Initialization?**

   * When the object is always needed or when delayed creation can cause performance issues.

10. **How do you initialize a Lazy object with a custom factory method?**

* By using `new Lazy<T>(() => new MyObject())`.

## 32. Service Locator Pattern

## Definition

The Service Locator Pattern is a design pattern used to obtain the required services at runtime without directly instantiating them. It provides a centralized registry (locator) that returns the appropriate service object upon request.

## When to Use

* When you want a centralized way to manage service instances in an application.
* When dependency injection is not feasible or becomes complex.
* When you want to dynamically resolve services without hardcoding dependencies.

## Key Components

1. **Service Locator (Registry)**: A centralized class that manages the services.
2. **Service Interface**: Defines the contract for the service.
3. **Concrete Service**: Implements the service interface.
4. **Client (Consumer)**: The code that uses the service without directly instantiating it.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a hotel concierge service. Guests can request various services (room service, taxi booking, spa) without directly contacting the providers. The concierge locates the appropriate service provider and arranges it for the guest.

## Full Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Service Interface
public interface IMessageService
{
    void SendMessage(string message);
}

// Concrete Service - Email
public class EmailService : IMessageService
{
    public void SendMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Email sent: {message}");
    }
}

// Concrete Service - SMS
public class SmsService : IMessageService
{
    public void SendMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"SMS sent: {message}");
    }
}

// Service Locator
public static class ServiceLocator
{
    private static readonly Dictionary<string, IMessageService> _services = new Dictionary<string, IMessageService>();

    // Register a service
    public static void RegisterService(string key, IMessageService service)
    {
        if (!_services.ContainsKey(key))
        {
            _services.Add(key, service);
        }
    }

    // Get a service
    public static IMessageService GetService(string key)
    {
        if (_services.TryGetValue(key, out var service))
        {
            return service;
        }

        throw new InvalidOperationException("Service not found.");
    }
}

// Usage
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Register services
        ServiceLocator.RegisterService("email", new EmailService());
        ServiceLocator.RegisterService("sms", new SmsService());

        // Use services
        var emailService = ServiceLocator.GetService("email");
        emailService.SendMessage("Hello via Email!");

        var smsService = ServiceLocator.GetService("sms");
        smsService.SendMessage("Hello via SMS!");
    }
}
```

## Benefits

* Failing to handle missing services, leading to runtime exceptions.

## 10 Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Service Locator Pattern in C#?**

   * It is a design pattern that provides a centralized registry for obtaining service instances at runtime.

2. **How does Service Locator differ from Dependency Injection?**

   * Service Locator pulls dependencies from a centralized registry, while Dependency Injection pushes dependencies into the consuming class.

3. **What are the key components of the Service Locator Pattern?**

   * Service Locator (Registry), Service Interface, Concrete Service, and Client.

4. **Can you provide a real-world example of Service Locator Pattern?**

   * A hotel concierge that provides access to various services (room service, taxi, spa) without directly contacting providers.

5. **What are the main benefits of using Service Locator Pattern?**

   * Centralized service management and dynamic service resolution.

6. **Is Service Locator an anti-pattern? Why?**

   * It can become an anti-pattern if overused, making code harder to test and understand.

7. **How do you register services in a Service Locator?**

   * By using a method like `RegisterService` that stores services in a dictionary.

8. **What is the disadvantage of using a static Service Locator?**

   * It introduces global state, making unit testing difficult.

9. **How does Service Locator follow the Open/Closed Principle?**

   * New services can be added without modifying existing code.

10. **How do you prevent a Service Locator from becoming an anti-pattern?**

* By limiting its use to non-critical services and avoiding it for core dependencies.

    public event Action<string> OnEvent;

    public void Publish(string message) => OnEvent?.Invoke(message);
}

// Reactive Event Subscriber
public class ReactiveSubscriber
{
    public void OnEventReceived(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Reactive Event Received: " + message);
    }
}

// Usage
var publisher = new ReactiveEventPublisher();
var subscriber = new ReactiveSubscriber();
publisher.OnEvent += subscriber.OnEventReceived;
publisher.Publish("Order Placed");
```
# Mastering Dependency Injection (DI) in ASP.NET Core

## Introduction

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that enables loose coupling between components in an application. In ASP.NET Core, DI is a first-class citizen and is natively supported by the framework.

### What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection is a technique where an object’s dependencies are provided externally, rather than the object creating them itself.

* **Why Use DI?**: It improves code maintainability, testability, and scalability.
* **How DI Works in ASP.NET Core?**: ASP.NET Core uses a built-in DI container that supports three main lifetimes: Transient, Scoped, and Singleton.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Types of Dependency Injection

* **Constructor Injection (Most Common)**: Dependencies are provided via the constructor.

  ```csharp
  public class NotificationService
  {
      private readonly IMessageService _messageService;

      public NotificationService(IMessageService messageService)
      {
          _messageService = messageService;
      }

      public void Notify(string message)
      {
          Console.WriteLine(_messageService.SendMessage(message));
      }
  }
  ```

* **Property Injection (Setter Injection)**: Dependencies are set via properties.

  ```csharp
  public class NotificationService
  {
      public IMessageService MessageService { get; set; }

      public void Notify(string message)
      {
          Console.WriteLine(MessageService?.SendMessage(message));
      }
  }
  ```

* **Method Injection**: Dependencies are passed as method parameters.

  ```csharp
  public class NotificationService
  {
      public void Notify(IMessageService messageService, string message)
      {
          Console.WriteLine(messageService.SendMessage(message));
      }
  }
  ```

### 2. DI Lifetime Scopes (In-Depth)

* **Transient**: A new instance is created each time the service is requested.

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddTransient<ITransientService, TransientService>();
  ```

* **Scoped**: A new instance is created once per request (HTTP request in a web app).

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddScoped<IScopedService, ScopedService>();
  ```

* **Singleton**: A single instance is created for the lifetime of the application.

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddSingleton<ISingletonService, SingletonService>();
  ```

## Advanced DI Techniques

* Using Factory Pattern with DI
* Implementing Scoped Services with Async Context
* DI in Middleware
* Conditional DI (based on environment)

## Watchouts

* Avoid injecting too many dependencies (Constructor Over-Injection).
* Use appropriate lifetime for services (Singleton for stateless services).
* Be careful with Scoped services in Singleton.
* Circular Dependencies should be avoided.
* Avoid using static services with DI.

## Summary

### Question and Answer Mastery

1. **What is Dependency Injection (DI)?**

   * DI is a design pattern where dependencies are injected into a class rather than the class creating them.

2. **Why should you use DI in ASP.NET Core?**

   * It promotes loose coupling, enhances testability, and improves maintainability.

3. **What are the three main service lifetimes in DI?**

   * Transient, Scoped, and Singleton.

4. **How do you register a service in DI in ASP.NET Core?**

   * Using `builder.Services.AddTransient`, `AddScoped`, or `AddSingleton` methods in Program.cs.

5. **What is Constructor Injection?**

   * Dependency is provided through the constructor of the class.

6. **What is Scoped Service?**

   * A service instance is created once per HTTP request.

7. **How does Singleton differ from Transient?**

   * Singleton creates a single instance for the application's lifetime, while Transient creates a new instance on every request.

8. **How do you resolve services manually?**

   * Using `IServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<T>()`.

9. **What is the risk of injecting Scoped services in Singleton?**

   * Scoped service instances may become singletons when injected into a Singleton, leading to unexpected behavior.

10. **How can you use DI in Middleware?**

* By injecting services via the constructor of the Middleware class.


# Mastering Middleware and Filters in ASP.NET Core

## Introduction

Middleware and Filters are two powerful concepts in ASP.NET Core that control how HTTP requests and responses flow through an application.

### What is Middleware?

Middleware is software that is assembled into an application pipeline to handle HTTP requests and responses. Each middleware component decides:

* Whether to pass the request to the next middleware.
* Whether to process the request and response.

### Why Use Middleware?

* Centralized request/response handling.
* Logging, Authentication, Exception Handling, CORS, and more.

### How Middleware Works?

* Middleware is added in `Program.cs` using `app.UseMiddleware<>()` or `app.Use()` methods.
* Order matters – Middleware is processed in the sequence it is added.
* Each middleware can decide to terminate the pipeline or pass the request to the next.

### Middleware vs Filters (Clear Comparison)

* **Middleware**: Affects the entire request pipeline, including static files, authentication, etc.
* **Filters**: Specific to MVC (Controller) actions, executing around action methods.

## Types of Middleware

1. Built-in Middleware (Exception Handling, Static Files, Routing, CORS).
2. Custom Middleware (User-defined logic).
3. Conditional Middleware (Environment-specific).

## Creating Custom Middleware (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Create a Custom Middleware Class

```csharp
public class RequestLoggingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public RequestLoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Request: {context.Request.Method} {context.Request.Path}");
        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Register Middleware in Pipeline

```csharp
app.UseMiddleware<RequestLoggingMiddleware>();
```

### Step 3: Test the Middleware

* Any HTTP request will now be logged.

### Advanced Custom Middleware with Dependency Injection

```csharp
public class HeaderInjectionMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger<HeaderInjectionMiddleware> _logger;

    public HeaderInjectionMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<HeaderInjectionMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        context.Response.OnStarting(() => {
            context.Response.Headers["X-Custom-Header"] = "Middleware Added Header";
            _logger.LogInformation("Custom Header Added");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        });

        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

### Registering the Advanced Middleware

```csharp
app.UseMiddleware<HeaderInjectionMiddleware>();
```

## Middleware Ordering Explained (Critical Concept)

* Order of middleware registration in `Program.cs` directly affects execution.
* Example:

```csharp
app.UseRouting(); // Routing Middleware
app.UseAuthentication(); // Authentication Middleware
app.UseAuthorization(); // Authorization Middleware
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => endpoints.MapControllers());
```

## Deep Dive into Filters

Filters are used to execute code before or after specific stages of request processing in MVC controllers.

### Types of Filters (In-Depth)

1. **Authorization Filters** - Validate user authentication and authorization.
2. **Resource Filters** - Execute before or after the entire request pipeline.
3. **Action Filters** - Execute code before or after an action method.
4. **Exception Filters** - Handle exceptions globally or locally.
5. **Result Filters** - Execute code before or after the action result.

### Implementing a Custom Action Filter

```csharp
public class CustomActionFilter : IActionFilter
{
    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Action Executing");
    }

    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Action Executed");
    }
}
```

### Applying Filter Globally

```csharp
builder.Services.AddControllers(options =>
{
    options.Filters.Add<CustomActionFilter>();
});
```

## Advanced Middleware and Filters Techniques

* Exception Handling Middleware with Custom Response
* Conditional Middleware (Using Environment Checks)
* Using Dependency Injection in Middleware
* Applying Filters Globally (Global Filters)
* Combining Middleware and Filters for Secure APIs

## Watchouts

* Middleware order is critical (Pipeline Sequence).
* Filters do not apply to non-MVC requests (like Web API).
* Avoid long-running tasks in Middleware.
* Be aware of filter conflicts (Authorization vs Action Filters).
* Avoid circular dependencies in Middleware.

## Summary

### Question and Answer Mastery

1. **What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?**

   * Middleware is a software component that processes HTTP requests and responses.

2. **How do you create Custom Middleware?**

   * By creating a class with an `InvokeAsync` method and registering it using `app.UseMiddleware<>`.

3. **What is the difference between Use, Run, and Map in Middleware?**

   * `Use`: Continues to next middleware.
   * `Run`: Terminates the pipeline.
   * `Map`: Conditionally branches the pipeline.

4. **What are Filters?**

   * Filters are components that run before or after specific stages of the request pipeline in controllers.

5. **What are the types of Filters?**

   * Authorization, Resource, Action, Exception, Result.

6. **How do you apply a Filter to a Controller?**

   * Using `[ServiceFilter]`, `[TypeFilter]`, or `[Authorize]`.

7. **How do you create a Custom Action Filter?**

   * By implementing `IActionFilter` and registering it.

8. **How do Middleware and Filters differ?**

   * Middleware is for the entire HTTP request pipeline, while Filters are for MVC actions.

9. **What is the significance of Middleware order?**

   * The order determines how requests are processed.

10. **How do you inject services in Middleware?**

* Using the constructor of the Middleware class with DI.

# Mastering Memory Management in ASP.NET Core

## Introduction

Memory management is a critical concept for any .NET developer, especially when building high-performance web applications with ASP.NET Core. Understanding how memory is allocated, managed, and freed is essential for writing efficient and scalable code.

### Why Memory Management is Important?

* Prevents memory leaks.
* Enhances application performance.
* Reduces unnecessary resource consumption.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Garbage Collection (GC)

* **What is Garbage Collection?**

  * Garbage Collection (GC) is an automatic memory management system in .NET.
  * It automatically frees memory that is no longer in use, preventing memory leaks.

* **GC Generations (Detailed):**

  * **Generation 0:** Short-lived objects. (e.g., local variables, temporary data)
  * **Generation 1:** Medium-lived objects. (e.g., cached data)
  * **Generation 2:** Long-lived objects. (e.g., static objects, global instances)

* **GC Modes (Advanced):**

  * **Workstation (Default for desktops):** Optimized for client applications.
  * **Server (Optimized for high-performance servers):** Multi-threaded collection.
  * **Background GC:** Runs concurrently with application code.

### 2. IDisposable and Using Statement

* **What is IDisposable?**

  * An interface that allows manual resource cleanup, especially for unmanaged resources.

* **Using Statement Explained:**

  ```csharp
  using (var stream = new FileStream("example.txt", FileMode.Open))
  {
      // File is automatically disposed of at the end of the block
  }
  ```

  * Using statement ensures that the resource is properly disposed even if an exception occurs.

* **Implementing IDisposable with Dispose Pattern:**

  ```csharp
  public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable
  {
      private bool _disposed = false;

      public void UseResource()
      {
          if (_disposed) throw new ObjectDisposedException("ResourceHolder");
          Console.WriteLine("Using Resource");
      }

      public void Dispose()
      {
          Dispose(true);
          GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
      }

      protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
      {
          if (_disposed) return;

          if (disposing)
          {
              // Release managed resources
              Console.WriteLine("Disposing managed resources");
          }

          // Release unmanaged resources
          Console.WriteLine("Disposing unmanaged resources");
          _disposed = true;
      }

      ~ResourceHolder()
      {
          Dispose(false);
      }
  }
  ```

### 3. Value Types vs Reference Types (Deep Dive)

* **Value Types:**

  * Stored in the stack.
  * Examples: `int`, `double`, `struct`, `bool`.
  * Memory is allocated immediately and destroyed once the method ends.

* **Reference Types:**

  * Stored in the heap.
  * Examples: `class`, `interface`, `array`, `string`.
  * Memory is managed by Garbage Collector.

### 4. Stack vs Heap Memory (In-Depth)

* **Stack Memory:**

  * Fast access (Last-In, First-Out - LIFO).
  * Stores value types and method call data.

* **Heap Memory:**

  * Slower but allows dynamic memory allocation.
  * Stores reference types and long-lived objects.

## Advanced Memory Management Techniques

### 1. Handling Large Object Heap (LOH)

* Objects larger than 85,000 bytes are stored in LOH.
* LOH is not compacted by default, which can cause memory fragmentation.
* Use `GCSettings.LargeObjectHeapCompactionMode` for manual compaction.

### 2. Avoiding Memory Leaks

* Always dispose of IDisposable objects.
* Use `WeakReference<T>` for cache without preventing GC.
* Avoid static event handlers (they prevent GC).

### 3. Understanding Finalization

* Finalizers (`~ClassName`) are called by GC before object destruction.
* Avoid long-running tasks in finalizers.

### 4. Advanced Tips

* Use `ArrayPool<T>` for reusable large arrays.
* Use `GC.Collect()` only for testing, not in production.
* Prefer `Span<T>` and `Memory<T>` for low-level optimizations.

## Watchouts

* Avoid memory leaks by disposing of resources properly.
* Be careful with large object allocations (LOH).
* Avoid circular references in managed objects.
* Do not call `GC.Collect()` in production.
* Understand the difference between Stack and Heap allocations.

## Summary

### Question and Answer Mastery

1. **What is Garbage Collection (GC) in .NET?**

   * GC is an automatic memory management system that reclaims unused objects.

2. **What are the GC generations?**

   * Generation 0 (short-lived), Generation 1 (medium-lived), Generation 2 (long-lived).

3. **What is the difference between stack and heap?**

   * Stack is for value types and method calls (LIFO), while Heap is for reference types and long-lived objects.

4. **What is IDisposable, and why is it important?**

   * IDisposable is an interface for manual resource cleanup, avoiding memory leaks.

5. **How does the `using` statement help with memory management?**

   * It ensures IDisposable objects are automatically disposed of when out of scope.

6. **What are Value Types and Reference Types?**

   * Value Types are stored in the stack, Reference Types are stored in the heap.

7. **How does the Dispose Pattern work?**

   * It provides a safe way to release both managed and unmanaged resources.

8. **What is the Large Object Heap (LOH)?**

   * A special heap for objects larger than 85,000 bytes.

9. **How do you prevent memory leaks in ASP.NET Core?**

   * Dispose of unmanaged resources, avoid static event handlers, use `WeakReference`.

10. **What is the difference between a weak reference and a strong reference?**

* A weak reference allows GC to collect the object even if it is referenced.


# Mastering ASP.NET Core Internals for Senior Developers

## Introduction

ASP.NET Core is a powerful, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, and cross-platform web applications. Understanding its internals is essential for senior developers who want to write optimized, scalable, and secure applications.

## Core Concepts

### 1. ASP.NET Core Request Processing Pipeline

* **What is the Request Pipeline?**

  * It is a series of middleware components that process HTTP requests and responses.
  * Each request goes through this pipeline, and each middleware can either process the request or pass it to the next.

* **How does it work? (Detailed Flow)**

  1. HTTP Request received by the Kestrel Server.
  2. Middleware processes the request in order (Exception Handling, Static Files, Routing).
  3. Routing Middleware identifies the matching route.
  4. MVC Middleware (Controller) processes the request.
  5. HTTP Response is sent back to the client.

### Request Pipeline Diagram

```plaintext
Client → Kestrel → Middleware 1 → Middleware 2 → Routing → Controller → Middleware 3 → Response
```

### 2. Hosting Model

* **Kestrel Web Server (Built-in)**

  * High-performance, cross-platform web server.
  * Can run as a standalone server or behind a reverse proxy (e.g., IIS, Nginx).

* **In-Process vs Out-of-Process Hosting (Detailed)**

  * **In-Process:** Runs directly inside IIS worker process (w3wp.exe).
  * **Out-of-Process:** Kestrel runs independently, with IIS as a reverse proxy.

### 3. Dependency Injection (DI) System

* **Built-in DI Container**

  * Supports Transient, Scoped, and Singleton lifetimes.

* **How DI Works Internally? (Advanced)**

  * Services are registered in the DI container.
  * DI resolves services using Constructor Injection.
  * The lifetime of each service is determined by its registration type (Transient, Scoped, Singleton).

### 4. Middleware Architecture

* Middleware are components that intercept HTTP requests.
* **Order Matters:** The order in which middleware is registered determines the flow.
* Example:

  ```csharp
  app.UseRouting();
  app.UseAuthentication();
  app.UseAuthorization();
  app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => endpoints.MapControllers());
  ```

### 5. Configuration System (In-Depth)

* **Multi-Source Configuration:** Supports JSON, XML, Environment Variables, Command Line, Azure Key Vault.
* **Configuration Providers:** Hierarchical key-value system (appsettings.json, appsettings.Development.json).
* **Accessing Configuration Values:**

  ```csharp
  var configValue = builder.Configuration["MySetting:SubSetting"];
  ```

### 6. Hosting and Startup

* **Program.cs and Startup.cs (ASP.NET Core 3.1 and below)**

  * Program.cs: Configures WebHost.
  * Startup.cs: Configures Services and Middleware.

* **Unified Hosting Model (ASP.NET Core 6 and above)**

  * Single Program.cs with WebApplicationBuilder.

  ```csharp
  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
  var app = builder.Build();
  app.Run();
  ```

### 7. Logging System (Detailed)

* **Integrated Logging Providers:** Console, Debug, EventSource, Application Insights.
* **Structured Logging with Serilog:**

  ```csharp
  builder.Logging.ClearProviders();
  builder.Logging.AddSerilog(new LoggerConfiguration().WriteTo.Console().CreateLogger());
  ```
* **Log Levels:** Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical.

### 8. Exception Handling

* **Global Exception Handling Middleware:**

  ```csharp
  app.UseExceptionHandler(errorApp =>
  {
      errorApp.Run(async context =>
      {
          context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";
          await context.Response.WriteAsync("{"Error":"An unexpected error occurred"}");
      });
  });
  ```

## Advanced Internals

* **Application Lifecycle:** How ASP.NET Core initializes and handles requests.
* **Threading and Async Programming:** Handling asynchronous requests efficiently.
* **Performance Optimization:** Response Caching, Compression, Connection Pooling.
* **Security Mechanisms:** Authentication, Authorization, CORS, Data Protection.
* **Advanced Configuration:** Environment-Specific Configuration, Secret Management, Azure Key Vault.
* **WebHostBuilder and GenericHostBuilder:** Understanding the hosting model.

## Watchouts

* Misconfiguring the middleware order can break the application.
* Be cautious with Singleton services that rely on Scoped services.
* Avoid tight coupling in DI (prefer interface-based injections).
* Always test configurations in production-like environments.

## Summary

### Question and Answer Mastery

1. **What is the ASP.NET Core request processing pipeline?**

   * It is a series of middleware components that handle HTTP requests and responses in a specific order.

2. **What is Kestrel, and how does it differ from IIS?**

   * Kestrel is a cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core, while IIS is a Windows-only web server that can proxy requests to Kestrel.

3. **How does Dependency Injection (DI) work internally?**

   * DI is managed by a built-in container that resolves services based on their registration (Transient, Scoped, Singleton).

4. **What are the different DI lifetimes?**

   * Transient (per request), Scoped (per HTTP request), Singleton (one instance for the app).

5. **What is the difference between In-Process and Out-of-Process Hosting?**

   * In-Process runs directly in IIS, while Out-of-Process uses Kestrel with IIS as a reverse proxy.

6. **What is the role of Program.cs and Startup.cs?**

   * Program.cs configures the host, Startup.cs configures services and middleware (pre-ASP.NET Core 6).

7. **How do you set up global exception handling?**

   * Using `app.UseExceptionHandler` with a custom handler in `Program.cs`.

8. **What is the purpose of the Configuration System?**

   * To provide hierarchical, multi-source configuration for the application.

9. **How does the Logging System work?**

   * Integrated with multiple providers (Console, Serilog, Application Insights), supports structured logging.

10. **What are best practices for Middleware configuration?**

* Use correct order, avoid long-running tasks, and secure sensitive endpoints.

# Mastering Configuration and Logging in ASP.NET Core

## Introduction

Configuration and Logging are two critical aspects of any ASP.NET Core application. They ensure that applications can be easily configured for different environments and that errors can be diagnosed efficiently.

## Configuration in ASP.NET Core

### 1. What is Configuration?

* Configuration is how application settings are defined, accessed, and managed.
* ASP.NET Core supports hierarchical configuration using key-value pairs.
* It allows for flexibility across different environments (Development, Staging, Production).

### 2. Configuration Sources (Comprehensive)

* **JSON Files:** appsettings.json, appsettings.Development.json.
* **Environment Variables:** OS-level configuration values.
* **Command-Line Arguments:** Configuration values passed during app startup.
* **User Secrets:** Secure storage for sensitive values (Development only).
* **Azure Key Vault:** Securely store and manage application secrets in Azure.
* **In-Memory Collection:** Useful for testing configurations.
* **INI Files and XML Files:** Alternative configuration formats.

### 3. Configuring Application Settings

* Example: appsettings.json

```json
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "SiteTitle": "My ASP.NET Core App",
    "MaxUserCount": 100,
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=myServer;Database=myDB;User Id=myUser;Password=myPass;"
    }
  }
}
```

* Accessing Configuration Values

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var siteTitle = builder.Configuration["AppSettings:SiteTitle"];
var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");
Console.WriteLine($"Site Title: {siteTitle}");
```

### 4. Environment-Specific Configuration

* Supports separate configurations for different environments (Development, Staging, Production).
* Automatically loads the correct appsettings file based on environment.
* Example: appsettings.Development.json

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Debug",
      "Microsoft": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Secret Management

* User Secrets for local development (secure sensitive information).

  ```bash
  dotnet user-secrets init
  dotnet user-secrets set "AppSettings:ApiKey" "my-secret-key"
  ```
* Azure Key Vault for production (secure secrets storage).

  * Securely access secrets without hardcoding them.

### 6. Strongly Typed Configuration (Advanced)

* Bind configuration values directly to a class.

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<AppSettings>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AppSettings"));

public class AppSettings
{
    public string SiteTitle { get; set; }
    public int MaxUserCount { get; set; }
}
```

* Accessing Strongly Typed Configuration

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly AppSettings _appSettings;

    public HomeController(IOptions<AppSettings> options)
    {
        _appSettings = options.Value;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        ViewData["Title"] = _appSettings.SiteTitle;
        return View();
    }
}
```

## Logging in ASP.NET Core

### 1. What is Logging?

* Logging is the process of recording information about the application’s execution.
* Helps with debugging, monitoring, and auditing.

### 2. Built-in Logging Providers

* Console
* Debug
* EventSource
* Application Insights (Azure)
* File Logging (using Serilog)

### 3. Configuring Logging (Detailed)

* Example Configuration in appsettings.json

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning"
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Customizing Logging

* Use ILogger<T> for type-based logging.

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly ILogger<HomeController> _logger;

    public HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Home page accessed.");
        return View();
    }
}
```

### 5. Structured Logging with Serilog (Advanced)

* Serilog is a popular logging library for ASP.NET Core.
* Supports structured logging (JSON format).

```csharp
using Serilog;

builder.Logging.ClearProviders();
builder.Logging.AddSerilog(new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.Console()
    .WriteTo.File("logs/log.txt", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)
    .CreateLogger());
```

### 6. Log Levels Explained (Advanced)

* Trace: Most detailed logs.
* Debug: Development-level logs.
* Information: General information.
* Warning: Unexpected situations, but not errors.
* Error: Error conditions.
* Critical: Severe errors that cause termination.

## Watchouts

* Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys).
* Set appropriate log levels in production (Warning or higher).
* Use structured logging for better log analysis (JSON format).
* Manage log file sizes with rolling file logging.

## Summary

### Question and Answer Mastery

1. **What is Configuration in ASP.NET Core?**

   * It is how application settings are managed and accessed from various sources.

2. **What are the common Configuration Sources?**

   * JSON Files, Environment Variables, Command-Line, User Secrets, Azure Key Vault.

3. **How do you access configuration values in code?**

   * Using `builder.Configuration["Key"]` or `GetSection()`.

4. **What is Environment-Specific Configuration?**

   * Different settings for Development, Staging, Production environments.

5. **How do you securely store secrets in ASP.NET Core?**

   * Using User Secrets for development and Azure Key Vault for production.

6. **What is Logging, and why is it important?**

   * Logging records application events for debugging, monitoring, and auditing.

7. **What are the built-in Logging Providers?**

   * Console, Debug, EventSource, Application Insights, Serilog (custom).

8. **How do you configure Logging Levels?**

   * In appsettings.json or programmatically (Debug, Information, Error).

9. **What is Structured Logging, and why is it useful?**

   * It provides logs in JSON format, making them easy to parse and analyze.

10. **How do you prevent logging sensitive information?**

* Avoid logging credentials, use logging filters, and secure secrets in Azure Key Vault.

## Introduction

Security and Identity are fundamental to building secure and scalable ASP.NET Core applications. This guide covers authentication, authorization, identity management, JWT, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and best practices for secure API development.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Authentication vs Authorization

* **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of a user.

  * Examples: Login with username and password, OAuth login with Google.
* **Authorization:** Determines what authenticated users can access.

  * Examples: Admin access, User read-only access.

### 2. Authentication Mechanisms (Detailed)

* **Cookie Authentication:** Uses cookies to track user sessions (stateful).
* **JWT Authentication (JSON Web Tokens):** Secure, stateless authentication for APIs.
* **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Secure authentication using external providers (Google, Facebook).

### 3. ASP.NET Core Identity (Comprehensive)

* **What is Identity?**

  * A complete user management system for ASP.NET Core.
  * Supports user registration, login, password management, two-factor authentication, email confirmation.

* **Configuring Identity in ASP.NET Core**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddIdentity<IdentityUser, IdentityRole>(options =>
{
    options.Password.RequireDigit = true;
    options.Password.RequiredLength = 8;
    options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedEmail = true;
})
.AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>()
.AddDefaultTokenProviders();
```

### 4. Secure Password Storage

* Passwords are hashed using secure hashing algorithms (PBKDF2, BCrypt).
* Example: Configuring password strength in Identity

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<IdentityOptions>(options =>
{
    options.Password.RequireDigit = true;
    options.Password.RequiredLength = 8;
    options.Password.RequireUppercase = true;
    options.Password.RequireNonAlphanumeric = true;
});
```

### 5. Role-Based Authorization (Granular)

* Roles are assigned to users to control access.
* Example: Admin Role

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public class AdminController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Dashboard()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

* Dynamically Adding Roles

```csharp
var roleManager = app.Services.GetRequiredService<RoleManager<IdentityRole>>();
await roleManager.CreateAsync(new IdentityRole("Admin"));
```

### 6. Policy-Based Authorization (Advanced)

* Fine-grained control over authorization.
* Example: Creating a custom policy

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("RequireAdmin", policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
    options.AddPolicy("AgeRequirement", policy => policy.RequireClaim("Age", "18"));
});
```

* Applying Policy in Controller

```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdmin")]
public class SecureController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult SecureArea()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

### 7. JWT Authentication (JSON Web Tokens) (Detailed)

* Secure, stateless authentication using JWT.
* Configuring JWT in Startup

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
.AddJwtBearer(options =>
{
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        ValidateIssuer = true,
        ValidateAudience = true,
        ValidateLifetime = true,
        ValidIssuer = "https://yourdomain.com",
        ValidAudience = "https://yourdomain.com",
        IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("YourSecretKey"))
    };
});
```

* Generating JWT Token

```csharp
public string GenerateJwtToken(string username)
{
    var claims = new[]
    {
        new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub, username),
        new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Jti, Guid.NewGuid().ToString())
    };

    var key = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("YourSecretKey"));
    var creds = new SigningCredentials(key, SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256);

    var token = new JwtSecurityToken(
        issuer: "https://yourdomain.com",
        audience: "https://yourdomain.com",
        claims: claims,
        expires: DateTime.Now.AddHours(1),
        signingCredentials: creds
    );

    return new JwtSecurityTokenHandler().WriteToken(token);
}
```

### 8. Advanced Security Techniques

* Custom Claims and Policies.
* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with Email or SMS.
* Secure Cookies with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`.
* Rate Limiting to prevent API abuse.
* Secure Headers (HSTS, Content Security Policy).
* Enforcing HTTPS with `app.UseHttpsRedirection()`.

## Watchouts

* Avoid weak password policies.
* Do not store user passwords in plain text.
* Always use HTTPS in production.
* Secure API keys in Azure Key Vault.
* Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity.

## 1. Basics of Data Structures

### What are Data Structures?

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Different data structures are optimized for different operations such as fast access, insertion, deletion, and searching.

### Why Data Structures Matter:

* Efficient data storage and access.
* Optimized performance for specific operations.
* Enables solving complex problems efficiently.

### Key Concepts to Understand:

* **Linear vs Non-Linear Structures:** Arrays, Lists (Linear) vs Trees, Graphs (Non-Linear).
* **Static vs Dynamic Structures:** Arrays (Fixed size) vs Lists, Trees (Flexible size).
* **Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous:** Arrays (Same type) vs Classes (Mixed types).

### Common Data Structure Operations:

* Insert (Adding an element)
* Delete (Removing an element)
* Search (Finding an element)
* Access (Retrieving an element)
* Update (Modifying an element)

### C# Code Example (Array Basics):

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Array Example - Static Data Structure
        int[] numbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

        // Accessing Elements
        Console.WriteLine("First Element: " + numbers[0]);

        // Iterating through the Array
        Console.WriteLine("All Elements:");
        foreach (var num in numbers)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(num);
        }

        // Modifying an Element
        numbers[2] = 10;
        Console.WriteLine("Modified Element at Index 2: " + numbers[2]);
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
First Element: 1
All Elements:
1
2
3
4
5
Modified Element at Index 2: 10
```

### Watchouts (Do's and Don'ts)

* ✅ Use Arrays for fixed-size data collections.
* ❌ Don’t use Arrays for dynamic data where size changes frequently.
* ✅ Use Lists for dynamic data collections.

---
## 2. Understanding Algorithms

### What are Algorithms?

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or instructions used to solve specific problems or perform tasks. They are the logic behind solving any computational problem.

### Why Algorithms Matter:

* Efficiently solve complex problems.
* Optimize performance (speed and memory).
* Provide a clear problem-solving approach.

### Key Characteristics of a Good Algorithm:

* **Input:** Takes zero or more inputs.
* **Output:** Produces at least one output.
* **Definiteness:** Each step is clearly defined.
* **Finiteness:** Terminates after a finite number of steps.
* **Effectiveness:** Steps must be simple and feasible.

### Types of Algorithms:

1. **Sorting Algorithms:** (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
2. **Searching Algorithms:** (Linear Search, Binary Search)
3. **Recursion Algorithms:** (Factorial, Fibonacci)
4. **Dynamic Programming:** (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence)
5. **Greedy Algorithms:** (Coin Change, Minimum Spanning Tree)
6. **Backtracking Algorithms:** (Sudoku Solver, N-Queens)
7. **Graph Algorithms:** (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra)

### Algorithm Analysis (Big-O Notation)

* **Time Complexity:** Measures how the running time of an algorithm grows with the input size.

  * O(1): Constant Time
  * O(n): Linear Time
  * O(n^2): Quadratic Time
  * O(log n): Logarithmic Time
  * O(n log n): Linear Logarithmic Time

* **Space Complexity:** Measures the memory usage of an algorithm.

### Example Algorithm: Linear Search (Simple Algorithm)

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int[] numbers = { 5, 3, 8, 4, 2 };
        int target = 4;

        int index = LinearSearch(numbers, target);
        Console.WriteLine(index >= 0 ? $"Element found at index {index}" : "Element not found");
    }

    static int LinearSearch(int[] array, int target)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)
        {
            if (array[i] == target)
                return i;
        }
        return -1; // Not found
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Element found at index 3
```

### Why This is Important:

* Linear Search is a basic algorithm for understanding the concept of searching.
* It has a Time Complexity of O(n), meaning it scales linearly with the input size.
* Understanding this helps you learn more efficient search algorithms like Binary Search (O(log n)).

### Watchouts (Do's and Don'ts)

* ✅ Understand the problem before choosing an algorithm.
* ❌ Don’t choose a complex algorithm for a simple problem.
* ✅ Optimize your algorithm for both time and space complexity.

## 3. Arrays and Lists

### Understanding Arrays

* **Definition:** Arrays are a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Fixed size.
  * Index-based (0-based index).
  * Fast access (O(1)) but slow insertion and deletion (O(n)).

### C# Code Example (Array)

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Array Example
        int[] numbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

        // Accessing Elements
        Console.WriteLine("First Element: " + numbers[0]);

        // Modifying Elements
        numbers[2] = 10;

        // Iterating through the Array
        Console.WriteLine("Array Elements:");
        foreach (var num in numbers)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(num);
        }
    }
}
```

### When to Use Arrays:

* ✅ Use Arrays for fixed-size data collections.
* ❌ Avoid Arrays for dynamic data where size changes frequently.

### Understanding Lists

* **Definition:** Lists are dynamic data structures that can grow or shrink in size.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Dynamically resizable.
  * Provides useful methods (Add, Remove, Contains).

### C# Code Example (List)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // List Example
        List<int> numberList = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };

        // Adding Elements
        numberList.Add(4);

        // Removing Elements
        numberList.Remove(2);

        // Iterating through the List
        Console.WriteLine("List Elements:");
        foreach (var num in numberList)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(num);
        }
    }
}
```

### Arrays vs Lists Comparison Table

| Aspect      | Arrays                       | Lists                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Size        | Fixed                        | Dynamic                            |
| Performance | Faster (Contiguous Memory)   | Slightly Slower (Dynamic Resizing) |
| Use Case    | Known, fixed-size data       | Dynamic, growing data              |
| Memory      | Contiguous Memory Allocation | Dynamic (Heap-based)               |
| Syntax      | `int[] numbers`              | `List<int> numbers`                |

### When to Use Lists:

* ✅ Use Lists for dynamic collections.
* ❌ Avoid Lists for fixed-size data.

### Watchouts (Do's and Don'ts)

* ✅ Prefer Arrays when size is fixed.
* ✅ Use Lists for flexible, resizable collections.
* ❌ Don’t use Lists for performance-critical tasks where memory is a concern.

## 4. Stacks and Queues

### Understanding Stacks

* **Definition:** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.
* **Common Operations:**

  * `Push`: Add an element to the top.
  * `Pop`: Remove the top element.
  * `Peek`: View the top element without removing it.
* **Use Cases:** Undo functionality, browser history, expression evaluation.

### C# Code Example (Stack)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Stack Example
        Stack<string> browserHistory = new Stack<string>();

        // Adding Elements (Push)
        browserHistory.Push("Homepage");
        browserHistory.Push("Products");
        browserHistory.Push("Cart");

        // Viewing the Top Element (Peek)
        Console.WriteLine("Current Page: " + browserHistory.Peek());

        // Removing Elements (Pop)
        browserHistory.Pop();

        Console.WriteLine("After Back: " + browserHistory.Peek());
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Current Page: Cart
After Back: Products
```

### When to Use Stacks:

* ✅ Use Stacks for LIFO operations (Undo, Redo, Call Stack).
* ❌ Avoid Stacks for random access operations.

---

### Understanding Queues

* **Definition:** A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle.
* **Common Operations:**

  * `Enqueue`: Add an element to the end.
  * `Dequeue`: Remove the first element.
  * `Peek`: View the first element without removing it.
* **Use Cases:** Print queue, task scheduling, messaging systems.

### C# Code Example (Queue)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Queue Example
        Queue<string> taskQueue = new Queue<string>();

        // Adding Elements (Enqueue)
        taskQueue.Enqueue("Task 1");
        taskQueue.Enqueue("Task 2");
        taskQueue.Enqueue("Task 3");

        // Viewing the First Element (Peek)
        Console.WriteLine("Next Task: " + taskQueue.Peek());

        // Removing Elements (Dequeue)
        taskQueue.Dequeue();

        Console.WriteLine("After Completing One Task: " + taskQueue.Peek());
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Next Task: Task 1
After Completing One Task: Task 2
```

### Stacks vs Queues Comparison Table

| Aspect   | Stack (LIFO)       | Queue (FIFO)               |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Order    | Last In, First Out | First In, First Out        |
| Use Case | Undo, Call Stack   | Task Scheduling, Messaging |
| Methods  | Push, Pop, Peek    | Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek     |

### When to Use Queues:

* ✅ Use Queues for FIFO operations (Task Scheduling, Messaging).
* ❌ Avoid Queues for random access operations.

### Watchouts (Do's and Don'ts)

* ✅ Prefer Stacks for LIFO tasks (Undo, Redo).
* ✅ Use Queues for FIFO tasks (Order Processing, Messaging).
* ❌ Don’t use Queues for fast access to elements.

## 5. Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

### Understanding Linked Lists

* **Definition:** A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (Node) is a separate object, and each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.
* **Types of Linked Lists:**

  * **Singly Linked List:** Nodes link only to the next node.
  * **Doubly Linked List:** Nodes link to both the next and previous nodes.
  * **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the first node.

### When to Use Linked Lists:

* ✅ Use Linked Lists for dynamic collections where insertions and deletions are frequent.
* ❌ Avoid Linked Lists for fast access by index (slow due to traversal).

---

### 5.1 Singly Linked List

### C# Code Example (Singly Linked List)

```csharp
using System;

class Node
{
    public int Data;
    public Node Next;

    public Node(int data)
    {
        Data = data;
        Next = null;
    }
}

class SinglyLinkedList
{
    private Node head;

    // Add Node to End
    public void Add(int data)
    {
        Node newNode = new Node(data);

        if (head == null)
        {
            head = newNode;
        }
        else
        {
            Node current = head;
            while (current.Next != null)
            {
                current = current.Next;
            }
            current.Next = newNode;
        }
    }

    // Display Linked List
    public void Display()
    {
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null)
        {
            Console.Write(current.Data + " -> ");
            current = current.Next;
        }
        Console.WriteLine("null");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        SinglyLinkedList list = new SinglyLinkedList();
        list.Add(10);
        list.Add(20);
        list.Add(30);
        list.Display();
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> null
```

### When to Use Singly Linked Lists:

* ✅ Use for simple, sequential data structures.
* ❌ Avoid for reverse traversal (not possible).

---

### 5.2 Doubly Linked List

### C# Code Example (Doubly Linked List)

```csharp
class DoublyNode
{
    public int Data;
    public DoublyNode Next;
    public DoublyNode Previous;

    public DoublyNode(int data)
    {
        Data = data;
        Next = null;
        Previous = null;
    }
}

class DoublyLinkedList
{
    private DoublyNode head;

    // Add Node to End
    public void Add(int data)
    {
        DoublyNode newNode = new DoublyNode(data);

        if (head == null)
        {
            head = newNode;
        }
        else
        {
            DoublyNode current = head;
            while (current.Next != null)
            {
                current = current.Next;
            }
            current.Next = newNode;
            newNode.Previous = current;
        }
    }

    // Display Linked List
    public void Display()
    {
        DoublyNode current = head;
        while (current != null)
        {
            Console.Write(current.Data + " <-> ");
            current = current.Next;
        }
        Console.WriteLine("null");
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
10 <-> 20 <-> 30 <-> null
```

### When to Use Doubly Linked Lists:

* ✅ Use for bidirectional traversal.
* ❌ Avoid for high memory usage (additional pointer).

---

### 5.3 Circular Linked List

### C# Code Example (Circular Linked List)

```csharp
class CircularLinkedList
{
    private Node head;

    // Add Node
    public void Add(int data)
    {
        Node newNode = new Node(data);

        if (head == null)
        {
            head = newNode;
            head.Next = head; // Circular Link
        }
        else
        {
            Node current = head;
            while (current.Next != head)
            {
                current = current.Next;
            }
            current.Next = newNode;
            newNode.Next = head;
        }
    }

    // Display Linked List
    public void Display()
    {
        if (head == null) return;

        Node current = head;
        do
        {
            Console.Write(current.Data + " -> ");
            current = current.Next;
        }
        while (current != head);

        Console.WriteLine("(Back to Head)");
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> (Back to Head)
```

### When to Use Circular Linked Lists:

* ✅ Use for circular data structures (round-robin, task scheduling).
* ❌ Avoid for complex data navigation.

## 6. Hashing (Dictionaries and HashSets)

### Understanding Hashing

* **Definition:** Hashing is a technique used to uniquely identify a specific object from a collection using a hash function.
* **Hash Function:** Converts input data into a fixed-size numeric hash value.

### Why Use Hashing?

* Fast data access (O(1) average time).
* Efficient for lookups, insertions, and deletions.

### Hash Tables vs HashSets

* **Hash Table:** Stores key-value pairs (Dictionary).
* **Hash Set:** Stores unique values without duplicates.

---

### 6.1 Dictionary (Hash Table)

### C# Code Example (Dictionary)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Dictionary Example
        Dictionary<string, int> phoneBook = new Dictionary<string, int>();

        // Adding Key-Value Pairs
        phoneBook.Add("Alice", 12345);
        phoneBook.Add("Bob", 67890);

        // Accessing Values
        Console.WriteLine("Alice's Number: " + phoneBook["Alice"]);

        // Checking Key Existence
        if (phoneBook.ContainsKey("Bob"))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Bob's Number: " + phoneBook["Bob"]);
        }

        // Iterating through Dictionary
        Console.WriteLine("All Entries:");
        foreach (var entry in phoneBook)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(entry.Key + " - " + entry.Value);
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Alice's Number: 12345
Bob's Number: 67890
All Entries:
Alice - 12345
Bob - 67890
```

### When to Use Dictionaries:

* ✅ Use for fast key-value lookups.
* ❌ Avoid for sorted data (use SortedDictionary).

---

### 6.2 HashSet

### C# Code Example (HashSet)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // HashSet Example
        HashSet<int> uniqueNumbers = new HashSet<int>();

        // Adding Elements
        uniqueNumbers.Add(1);
        uniqueNumbers.Add(2);
        uniqueNumbers.Add(3);

        // Attempting to Add Duplicates
        uniqueNumbers.Add(2);

        // Displaying HashSet
        Console.WriteLine("Unique Numbers:");
        foreach (var num in uniqueNumbers)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(num);
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Unique Numbers:
1
2
3
```

### When to Use HashSets:

* ✅ Use for fast lookups of unique values.
* ❌ Avoid for duplicate values or sorted data.

---

### Hash Tables vs Hash Sets Comparison Table

| Aspect     | Dictionary (Hash Table)    | HashSet                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Storage    | Key-Value Pairs            | Unique Values              |
| Duplicates | Keys must be unique        | No Duplicates              |
| Use Case   | Phone Book, Product Prices | Unique Elements Collection |
| Access     | O(1) Average Time          | O(1) Average Time          |

### Watchouts (Do's and Don'ts)

* ✅ Prefer Dictionary for key-value pairs.
* ✅ Use HashSet for fast lookups of unique values.
* ❌ Don’t use HashSet for maintaining duplicate values.

## 7. Trees (Binary, Binary Search Tree, AVL, Red-Black)

### Understanding Trees

* **Definition:** Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes, with a root node at the top and child nodes branching out.
* **Key Concepts:**

  * **Root:** The top node of the tree.
  * **Node:** Each element in the tree.
  * **Leaf:** A node without children.
  * **Parent and Child:** Nodes connected by a branch.

### Types of Trees

1. **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children (left and right).
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A Binary Tree with an ordering rule:

   * Left Child < Parent
   * Right Child > Parent
3. **AVL Tree:** A self-balancing BST where the height difference between left and right subtrees is at most 1.
4. **Red-Black Tree:** A self-balancing BST with color properties for balancing.

---

### 7.1 Binary Tree

### C# Code Example (Binary Tree)

```csharp
using System;

class TreeNode
{
    public int Value;
    public TreeNode Left;
    public TreeNode Right;

    public TreeNode(int value)
    {
        Value = value;
        Left = null;
        Right = null;
    }
}

class BinaryTree
{
    public TreeNode Root;

    // Add Node
    public void Add(int value)
    {
        Root = AddRecursive(Root, value);
    }

    private TreeNode AddRecursive(TreeNode node, int value)
    {
        if (node == null) return new TreeNode(value);

        if (value < node.Value)
            node.Left = AddRecursive(node.Left, value);
        else if (value > node.Value)
            node.Right = AddRecursive(node.Right, value);

        return node;
    }

    // Display In-Order
    public void DisplayInOrder(TreeNode node)
    {
        if (node == null) return;

        DisplayInOrder(node.Left);
        Console.Write(node.Value + " ");
        DisplayInOrder(node.Right);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        BinaryTree tree = new BinaryTree();
        tree.Add(50);
        tree.Add(30);
        tree.Add(70);
        tree.Add(20);
        tree.Add(40);
        tree.Add(60);
        tree.Add(80);

        Console.WriteLine("In-Order Traversal:");
        tree.DisplayInOrder(tree.Root);
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
In-Order Traversal:
20 30 40 50 60 70 80
```

### When to Use Binary Trees:

* ✅ Use for hierarchical data (file systems, organization charts).
* ❌ Avoid for fast random access (use Arrays).

---

### 7.2 Binary Search Tree (BST)

* Same structure as Binary Tree with a sorting rule:

  * Left Child < Parent
  * Right Child > Parent

### Advantages of BST:

* Fast search (O(log n) average).
* Sorted data structure.

### Drawbacks:

* Can become unbalanced (skewed).

### C# Code Example (Binary Search Tree)

* The above Binary Tree code is already a Binary Search Tree.

---

### 7.3 AVL Tree

* A self-balancing BST with height difference check.
* Rebalances itself on insertions and deletions.

### Key Properties:

* Height difference between left and right subtrees is at most 1.
* Automatically balances itself.

### When to Use AVL Trees:

* ✅ Use for high-performance searching with balanced structure.
* ❌ Avoid for high insertion/deletion rates (slightly slower).

---

### 7.4 Red-Black Tree

* Another self-balancing BST with color properties:

  * Each node is either Red or Black.
  * Root is always Black.
  * Red nodes cannot have Red children.

### Key Benefits:

* Faster balancing than AVL Trees.

### When to Use Red-Black Trees:

* ✅ Use for general-purpose balanced tree structures.
* ❌ Avoid for strict height balancing (use AVL).

### Trees Comparison Table

| Tree Type          | Self-Balancing | Use Case                               | Average Search |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Binary Tree        | ❌              | General hierarchical data              | O(n)           |
| Binary Search Tree | ❌              | Sorted data, fast search               | O(log n)       |
| AVL Tree           | ✅              | Strictly balanced, fast search         | O(log n)       |
| Red-Black Tree     | ✅              | General balanced tree (faster inserts) | O(log n)       |


## 8. Heaps and Priority Queues

### Understanding Heaps

* **Definition:** A Heap is a specialized Tree-based data structure that satisfies the **Heap Property**:

  * **Min-Heap:** Parent nodes are smaller than their children.
  * **Max-Heap:** Parent nodes are larger than their children.
* **Use Cases:** Priority Queue, Scheduling, Pathfinding (Dijkstra's Algorithm).

### Key Characteristics:

* Complete Binary Tree (all levels are filled except the last, which is filled from left to right).
* Efficient insertion and deletion (O(log n)).

---

### 8.1 Min-Heap (Priority Queue)

### C# Code Example (Min-Heap using PriorityQueue)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Min-Heap using PriorityQueue
        PriorityQueue<int, int> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<int, int>();

        // Adding Elements
        minHeap.Enqueue(5, 5);
        minHeap.Enqueue(2, 2);
        minHeap.Enqueue(8, 8);
        minHeap.Enqueue(1, 1);

        Console.WriteLine("Min-Heap Elements:");
        while (minHeap.Count > 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(minHeap.Dequeue());
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Min-Heap Elements:
1
2
5
8
```

### When to Use Min-Heap:

* ✅ Use for scheduling (task priority).
* ✅ Use for pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra).

---

### 8.2 Max-Heap

### C# Code Example (Max-Heap using PriorityQueue)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Max-Heap using custom comparer (negative priority)
        PriorityQueue<int, int> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<int, int>(Comparer<int>.Create((a, b) => b - a));

        // Adding Elements
        maxHeap.Enqueue(5, 5);
        maxHeap.Enqueue(2, 2);
        maxHeap.Enqueue(8, 8);
        maxHeap.Enqueue(1, 1);

        Console.WriteLine("Max-Heap Elements:");
        while (maxHeap.Count > 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(maxHeap.Dequeue());
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Max-Heap Elements:
8
5
2
1
```

### When to Use Max-Heap:

* ✅ Use for highest priority tasks.
* ✅ Use for game leaderboards, data ranking.

---

### 8.3 Heaps vs Priority Queues

| Aspect    | Heap (Tree)                 | Priority Queue (Abstract Data Type) |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Structure | Complete Binary Tree        | Abstract Queue (Heap-based)         |
| Order     | Min-Heap (Smallest at Root) | Min or Max based on priority        |
| Use Case  | Efficient sorting, Dijkstra | Scheduling, Task Management         |

### Watchouts (Do's and Don'ts)

* ✅ Use Min-Heap for shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra).
* ✅ Use Max-Heap for highest priority tasks.
* ❌ Don’t use Heaps for general-purpose data storage.

## 9. Graphs (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm)

### Understanding Graphs

* **Definition:** A Graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
* **Types of Graphs:**

  * **Directed Graph:** Edges have a direction (one-way).
  * **Undirected Graph:** Edges are bidirectional.
  * **Weighted Graph:** Edges have weights (costs).
  * **Unweighted Graph:** Edges have no weights.

### Key Terminology:

* **Vertex (Node):** A point in the graph.
* **Edge:** A connection between two vertices.
* **Path:** A sequence of vertices connected by edges.
* **Cycle:** A path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

---

### 9.1 Depth-First Search (DFS)

### C# Code Example (DFS)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Graph
{
    private Dictionary<int, List<int>> adjacencyList = new Dictionary<int, List<int>>();

    // Add Edge (Undirected)
    public void AddEdge(int u, int v)
    {
        if (!adjacencyList.ContainsKey(u))
            adjacencyList[u] = new List<int>();

        if (!adjacencyList.ContainsKey(v))
            adjacencyList[v] = new List<int>();

        adjacencyList[u].Add(v);
        adjacencyList[v].Add(u);
    }

    // Depth-First Search
    public void DFS(int start)
    {
        HashSet<int> visited = new HashSet<int>();
        DFSRecursive(start, visited);
    }

    private void DFSRecursive(int vertex, HashSet<int> visited)
    {
        visited.Add(vertex);
        Console.Write(vertex + " ");

        foreach (var neighbor in adjacencyList[vertex])
        {
            if (!visited.Contains(neighbor))
                DFSRecursive(neighbor, visited);
        }
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Graph graph = new Graph();
        graph.AddEdge(1, 2);
        graph.AddEdge(1, 3);
        graph.AddEdge(2, 4);
        graph.AddEdge(3, 5);

        Console.WriteLine("DFS Traversal:");
        graph.DFS(1);
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
DFS Traversal:
1 2 4 3 5
```

### When to Use DFS:

* ✅ Use for exploring all connected nodes (Maze Solving, Tree Traversal).
* ❌ Avoid for shortest path problems (use BFS or Dijkstra).

---

### 9.2 Breadth-First Search (BFS)

### C# Code Example (BFS)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Graph

    // Add Weighted Edge
    public void AddEdge(int u, int v, int weight)
    {
        if (!adjacencyList.ContainsKey(u))
            adjacencyList[u] = new List<(int, int)>();

        adjacencyList[u].Add((v, weight));
    }

    // Dijkstra's Algorithm
    public void Dijkstra(int start)
    {
        Dictionary<int, int> distances = new Dictionary<int, int>();
        foreach (var vertex in adjacencyList.Keys)
            distances[vertex] = int.MaxValue;

        distances[start] = 0;
        PriorityQueue<int, int> pq = new PriorityQueue<int, int>();
        pq.Enqueue(start, 0);

        while (pq.Count > 0)
        {
            int current = pq.Dequeue();

            foreach (var (neighbor, weight) in adjacencyList[current])
            {
                int newDist = distances[current] + weight;

                if (newDist < distances[neighbor])
                {
                    distances[neighbor] = newDist;
                    pq.Enqueue(neighbor, newDist);
                }
            }
        }

        Console.WriteLine("Shortest Distances:");
        foreach (var kvp in distances)
            Console.WriteLine($"Node {kvp.Key}: {kvp.Value}");
    }
}

* **Key Characteristics:**

  * A base case (termination condition).
  * A recursive case (function calls itself).
* **Use Cases:** Factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence, Tree traversal, Backtracking.

### 12.1 Simple Recursion - Factorial

### C# Code Example (Recursive Factorial)

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int number = 5;
        int result = Factorial(number);
        Console.WriteLine($"Factorial of {number} is {result}");
    }

    static int Factorial(int n)
    {
        if (n == 0) return 1; // Base Case
        return n * Factorial(n - 1); // Recursive Case
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

### When to Use Recursion:

* ✅ Use for problems that can be divided into similar subproblems.
* ❌ Avoid for large problems (risk of stack overflow).

---

### 12.2 Backtracking - N-Queens Problem

### What is Backtracking?

* **Definition:** Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems by trying all possibilities and abandoning (backtracking) those that do not meet the solution criteria.
* **Use Cases:** N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Maze Solving, Permutations.

### C# Code Example (N-Queens Problem)

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int n = 4;
        int[,] board = new int[n, n];

        if (SolveNQueens(board, 0))
            DisplayBoard(board);
        else
            Console.WriteLine("No solution found.");
    }

    static bool SolveNQueens(int[,] board, int row)
    {
        int n = board.GetLength(0);

        if (row >= n) return true; // Solution found

        for (int col = 0; col < n; col++)
        {
            if (IsSafe(board, row, col))
            {
                board[row, col] = 1;

                if (SolveNQueens(board, row + 1))
                    return true;

                board[row, col] = 0; // Backtrack
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    static bool IsSafe(int[,] board, int row, int col)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++)
            if (board[i, col] == 1) return false;

        for (int i = row, j = col; i >= 0 && j >= 0; i--, j--)
            if (board[i, j] == 1) return false;

        for (int i = row, j = col; i >= 0 && j < board.GetLength(0); i--, j++)
            if (board[i, j] == 1) return false;

        return true;
    }

    static void DisplayBoard(int[,] board)
    {
        int n = board.GetLength(0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                Console.Write(board[i, j] + " ");
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
1 0 0 0 
0 0 1 0 
0 0 0 1 
0 1 0 0 
```

### When to Use Backtracking:

* ✅ Use for problems with multiple possibilities (Sudoku, N-Queens).
* ❌ Avoid for large problem spaces without optimization.

### Recursion vs Iteration

| Aspect       | Recursion                         | Iteration                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Memory Usage | Higher (Call Stack)               | Lower (Looping)                     |
| Readability  | Clear for problems like Factorial | Less intuitive for complex problems |
| Performance  | Risk of Stack Overflow            | Faster for large data               |

## 13. Dynamic Programming

### Understanding Dynamic Programming

* **Definition:** Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
* **Key Characteristics:**

  * Optimal Substructure: The problem can be divided into smaller, independent subproblems.
  * Overlapping Subproblems: The same subproblem is solved multiple times.
* **Two Approaches:**

  * Top-Down (Memoization): Recursion + Caching results.
  * Bottom-Up (Tabulation): Iterative + Table to store results.

### 13.1 Fibonacci Sequence (Top-Down - Memoization)

### C# Code Example (Fibonacci - Top-Down)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int n = 10;
        Console.WriteLine($"Fibonacci of {n} is {Fibonacci(n)}");
    }

    static Dictionary<int, long> memo = new Dictionary<int, long>();

    static long Fibonacci(int n)
    {
        if (n <= 1) return n;

        if (memo.ContainsKey(n)) return memo[n];

        memo[n] = Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2);
        return memo[n];
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Fibonacci of 10 is 55
```

### When to Use Memoization:

* ✅ Use for recursive problems with overlapping subproblems.
* ❌ Avoid for problems without overlapping subproblems.

---

### 13.2 Fibonacci Sequence (Bottom-Up - Tabulation)

### C# Code Example (Fibonacci - Bottom-Up)

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int n = 10;
        Console.WriteLine($"Fibonacci of {n} is {Fibonacci(n)}");
    }

    static long Fibonacci(int n)
    {
        if (n <= 1) return n;

        long[] dp = new long[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Fibonacci of 10 is 55
```

### When to Use Tabulation:

* ✅ Use for iterative problems with overlapping subproblems.
* ❌ Avoid for problems where recursion is clearer.

---

### 13.3 Knapsack Problem (0/1 Knapsack)

### Problem Explanation

* Given a set of items with weights and values, determine the maximum value that can be obtained with a limited capacity.

### C# Code Example (0/1 Knapsack - Bottom-Up)

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int[] weights = { 1, 3, 4, 5 };
        int[] values = { 15, 50, 60, 90 };
        int capacity = 8;

        Console.WriteLine($"Maximum Value: {Knapsack(weights, values, capacity)}");
    }

    static int Knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity)
    {
        int n = weights.Length;
        int[,] dp = new int[n + 1, capacity + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        {
            for (int w = 0; w <= capacity; w++)
            {
                if (weights[i - 1] <= w)
                    dp[i, w] = Math.Max(dp[i - 1, w], dp[i - 1, w - weights[i - 1]] + values[i - 1]);
                else
                    dp[i, w] = dp[i - 1, w];
            }
        }

        return dp[n, capacity];
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Maximum Value: 150
```

### When to Use Dynamic Programming:

* ✅ Use for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
* ❌ Avoid for problems without these characteristics.

### Identifying DP Problems

* Look for problems with "maximum," "minimum," "count ways," or "combinations.".

## 14. Greedy Algorithms

### Understanding Greedy Algorithms

* **Definition:** Greedy Algorithms are optimization techniques that build a solution by making a series of choices, each of which is the best local decision at that point.
* **Key Characteristics:**

  * Local Optimal Choice: Each decision is made to achieve the best immediate result.
  * No Backtracking: Once a choice is made, it cannot be changed.
* **Common Use Cases:** Coin Change Problem, Activity Selection, Fractional Knapsack.

### 14.1 Coin Change Problem (Greedy)

        List<int> result = CoinChange(coins, amount);
        Console.WriteLine("Coins Used: " + string.Join(", ", result));
    }

    static List<int> CoinChange(int[] coins, int amount)
    {
        Array.Sort(coins, (a, b) => b - a); // Sort coins in descending order

### 14.2 Activity Selection Problem

### Problem Explanation

* Given a list of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

### C# Code Example (Activity Selection)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        (int, int)[] activities = { (1, 4), (3, 5), (0, 6), (5, 7), (8, 9), (5, 9) };
        var selected = ActivitySelection(activities);

        Console.WriteLine("Selected Activities:");
        foreach (var activity in selected)
            Console.WriteLine($"Start: {activity.Item1}, End: {activity.Item2}");
    }

    static List<(int, int)> ActivitySelection((int, int)[] activities)
    {
        Array.Sort(activities, (a, b) => a.Item2.CompareTo(b.Item2)); // Sort by finish time

        List<(int, int)> result = new List<(int, int)>();
        int lastEnd = 0;

        foreach (var activity in activities)
        {
            if (activity.Item1 >= lastEnd)
            {
                result.Add(activity);
                lastEnd = activity.Item2;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### Output:

```

## 15. Performance Analysis (Big-O Notation)

### Understanding Big-O Notation

* **Definition:** Big-O Notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the performance of an algorithm in terms of its time and space complexity as the input size grows.
* **Why It Matters:** Big-O helps you understand how an algorithm will scale with larger inputs.

### Key Big-O Notations

| Notation   | Description       | Example Use Cases                 |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| O(1)       | Constant Time     | Accessing an array element        |
| O(log n)   | Logarithmic Time  | Binary Search                     |
| O(n)       | Linear Time       | Linear Search, Iterating an array |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic Time | Merge Sort, Quick Sort            |
| O(n^2)     | Quadratic Time    | Bubble Sort, Selection Sort       |
| O(2^n)     | Exponential Time  | Fibonacci (Recursive)             |
| O(n!)      | Factorial Time    | Permutations, N-Queens            |

### Understanding Time Complexity

* **Best Case:** The fastest an algorithm can run for a specific input.
* **Average Case:** The expected performance for random inputs.
* **Worst Case:** The slowest an algorithm can run for any input.

### Analyzing Time Complexity with Examples

#### Example 1: Accessing an Array Element (O(1))

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
Console.WriteLine(numbers[2]); // O(1) - Direct Access
```

#### Example 2: Linear Search (O(n))

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
int target = 4;

foreach (var num in numbers)
{
    if (num == target)
        Console.WriteLine("Found");
}
```

#### Example 3: Binary Search (O(log n))

```csharp
Array.Sort(numbers); // Sorted Array
int index = Array.BinarySearch(numbers, target); // O(log n)
```

#### Example 4: Nested Loops (O(n^2))

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < numbers.Length; j++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(numbers[i] + numbers[j]);
    }
}
```

### Understanding Space Complexity

* **Definition:** Space complexity measures the memory an algorithm requires to run as the input size grows.
* **Example:** An algorithm with O(1) space complexity uses a fixed amount of memory.

### Analyzing Space Complexity with Examples

#### Example 1: Constant Space (O(1))

```csharp
int sum = 0; // Single variable - O(1)
```

#### Example 2: Linear Space (O(n))

```csharp
int[] numbers = new int[n]; // Array of size n - O(n)
```

#### Example 3: Recursive Space (O(n))

```csharp
static int Factorial(int n)
{
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    return n * Factorial(n - 1); // O(n) Stack Space
}
```

### Best Practices for Performance Optimization

* ✅ Prefer algorithms with lower time complexity (O(log n) or O(n)).
* ✅ Minimize nested loops (O(n^2) or worse).
* ✅ Use data structures that offer fast access (Dictionaries, HashSets).
* ✅ Avoid excessive recursion without memoization.

78. **Q: What is KMP Algorithm? When is it used?**

* **A:** Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) is a string matching algorithm that avoids redundant comparisons, used in substring search (O(n + m)).

79. **Q: What is a Bellman-Ford Algorithm? How does it differ from Dijkstra?**

* **A:** Bellman-Ford finds shortest paths even with negative weights (O(V \* E)), unlike Dijkstra which fails with negative weights.

80. **Q: What is Floyd-Warshall Algorithm? Where is it used?**

* **A:** It is an algorithm for finding shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph (O(V^3)).
