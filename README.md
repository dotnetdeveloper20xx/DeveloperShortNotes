# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a foundational paradigm in software development. This guide will take you through the core OOP principles in C# with clear explanations, full code examples with comments, and practical best practices.

## Core OOP Principles

1. **Encapsulation**

   * **What:** Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
   * **Why:** Protects data integrity and simplifies maintenance.
   * **How:** Use access modifiers (private, public, protected, internal).

### Code Example (Encapsulation)

```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance; // Private field (Encapsulated)

    public decimal GetBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
        {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance)
        {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Inheritance**

   * **What:** A mechanism to create a new class using properties and behaviors of an existing class.
   * **Why:** Promotes code reuse and hierarchical relationships.
   * **How:** Use the `: baseClass` syntax in C#.

### Code Example (Inheritance)

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating");
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark() => Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking");
}
}
```

3. **Polymorphism**

   * **What:** The ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same type.
   * **Why:** Allows for flexible and scalable code.
   * **How:** Achieved through method overriding and interfaces.

### Code Example (Polymorphism)

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound");
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Cat meows");
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
}
```

4. **Abstraction**

   * **What:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality.
   * **Why:** Simplifies interface usage and increases security.
   * **How:** Use abstract classes or interfaces.

### Code Example (Abstraction)

```csharp
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double CalculateArea();
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius)
    {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

## Watchouts, Do's and Don'ts

* **Encapsulation:** Avoid making fields public; always use properties.
* **Inheritance:** Prefer composition over inheritance if there is no "is-a" relationship.
* **Polymorphism:** Always use `override` when overriding methods.
* **Abstraction:** Keep abstract methods generic; avoid implementation logic in abstract classes.

## Summary: Questions and Answers

1. **What is Encapsulation?**

   * Encapsulation is the concept of hiding internal data and exposing only necessary methods.

2. **How does Inheritance promote code reuse?**

   * Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.

3. **What is Polymorphism, and how is it achieved in C#?**

   * Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as the same type, achieved using method overriding and interfaces.

4. **What is the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface?**

   * Abstract classes can have implementations, while interfaces only define methods.

5. **How do you achieve encapsulation in C#?**

   * By using access modifiers (private, public, protected) to control access to fields and methods.

6. **When should you use Interfaces over Abstract Classes?**

   * Use interfaces for pure contracts without implementation, and abstract classes for partial implementations.

7. **What are the key differences between Inheritance and Composition?**

   * Inheritance creates an "is-a" relationship, while composition creates a "has-a" relationship.

8. **How can Polymorphism lead to flexible code?**

   * It allows methods to be called on objects of different types without knowing their specific type.

9. **What are access modifiers in C#?**

   * Access modifiers define the visibility of class members (public, private, protected, internal).

10. **What are the benefits of using OOP principles?**

* OOP promotes modular, maintainable, reusable, and scalable code.
