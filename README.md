# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a foundational paradigm in software development. This guide will take you through the core OOP principles in C# with clear explanations, full code examples with comments, and practical best practices.

## Core OOP Principles

1. **Encapsulation**

   * **What:** Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
   * **Why:** Protects data integrity and simplifies maintenance.
   * **How:** Use access modifiers (private, public, protected, internal).

### Code Example (Encapsulation)

```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance; // Private field (Encapsulated)

    public decimal GetBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
        {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance)
        {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Inheritance**

   * **What:** A mechanism to create a new class using properties and behaviors of an existing class.
   * **Why:** Promotes code reuse and hierarchical relationships.
   * **How:** Use the `: baseClass` syntax in C#.

### Code Example (Inheritance)

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating");
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark() => Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking");
}
}
```

3. **Polymorphism**

   * **What:** The ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same type.
   * **Why:** Allows for flexible and scalable code.
   * **How:** Achieved through method overriding and interfaces.

### Code Example (Polymorphism)

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound");
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Cat meows");
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
}
```

4. **Abstraction**

   * **What:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality.
   * **Why:** Simplifies interface usage and increases security.
   * **How:** Use abstract classes or interfaces.

### Code Example (Abstraction)

```csharp
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double CalculateArea();
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius)
    {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

## Watchouts, Do's and Don'ts

* **Encapsulation:** Avoid making fields public; always use properties.
* **Inheritance:** Prefer composition over inheritance if there is no "is-a" relationship.
* **Polymorphism:** Always use `override` when overriding methods.
* **Abstraction:** Keep abstract methods generic; avoid implementation logic in abstract classes.

## Summary: Questions and Answers

1. **What is Encapsulation?**

   * Encapsulation is the concept of hiding internal data and exposing only necessary methods.

2. **How does Inheritance promote code reuse?**

   * Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.

3. **What is Polymorphism, and how is it achieved in C#?**

   * Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as the same type, achieved using method overriding and interfaces.

4. **What is the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface?**

   * Abstract classes can have implementations, while interfaces only define methods.

5. **How do you achieve encapsulation in C#?**

   * By using access modifiers (private, public, protected) to control access to fields and methods.

6. **When should you use Interfaces over Abstract Classes?**

   * Use interfaces for pure contracts without implementation, and abstract classes for partial implementations.

7. **What are the key differences between Inheritance and Composition?**

   * Inheritance creates an "is-a" relationship, while composition creates a "has-a" relationship.

8. **How can Polymorphism lead to flexible code?**

   * It allows methods to be called on objects of different types without knowing their specific type.

9. **What are access modifiers in C#?**

   * Access modifiers define the visibility of class members (public, private, protected, internal).

10. **What are the benefits of using OOP principles?**

* OOP promotes modular, maintainable, reusable, and scalable code.


# SOLID Principles and Design Patterns

## Section 1: SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

   * **What:** A class should have only one reason to change.
   * **Why:** This promotes maintainability and avoids tightly coupled code.
   * **How:** Separate responsibilities into distinct classes.

### Code Example (SRP)

```csharp
public class Order
{
    public void PlaceOrder() => Console.WriteLine("Order Placed.");
}

public class OrderLogger
{
    public void LogOrder() => Console.WriteLine("Order Logged.");
}
```

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

   * **What:** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   * **Why:** This allows new features without altering existing code.
   * **How:** Use inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.

### Code Example (OCP)

```csharp
public interface IDiscount
{
    double ApplyDiscount(double amount);
}

public class NoDiscount : IDiscount
{
    public double ApplyDiscount(double amount) => amount;
}

public class SeasonalDiscount : IDiscount
{
    public double ApplyDiscount(double amount) => amount * 0.9;
}
```

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

   * **What:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
   * **Why:** Prevents unexpected behavior.
   * **How:** Use interfaces or base classes with clear contracts.

### Code Example (LSP)

```csharp
public class Bird
{
    public virtual void Fly() => Console.WriteLine("Bird is flying");
}

public class Sparrow : Bird { }

public class Ostrich : Bird
{
    public override void Fly() => throw new NotSupportedException("Ostrich cannot fly");
}
```

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

   * **What:** Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
   * **Why:** Promotes modularity and flexibility.
   * **How:** Create small, specific interfaces.

### Code Example (ISP)

```csharp
public interface IPrinter
{
    void Print();
}

public interface IScanner
{
    void Scan();
}

public class MultiFunctionPrinter : IPrinter, IScanner
{
    public void Print() => Console.WriteLine("Printing...");
    public void Scan() => Console.WriteLine("Scanning...");
}
```

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

   * **What:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
   * **Why:** Promotes decoupled code.
   * **How:** Use dependency injection and interfaces.

### Code Example (DIP)

```csharp
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

public class ConsoleLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message);
}

public class OrderService
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public OrderService(ILogger logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void ProcessOrder()
    {
        _logger.Log("Order processed.");
    }
}
```

## Watchouts, Do's and Don'ts

* Avoid violating SOLID principles to keep code maintainable.
* Prefer interfaces over concrete classes for dependency injection.
* Ensure design patterns solve real problems, not add unnecessary complexity.

## Summary: Questions and Answers

1. **What is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?**

   * SRP means a class should only have one reason to change. It ensures that each class has one clear responsibility, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

2. **How does the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) support extensibility?**

   * OCP means classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. You can add new functionality without altering existing code, using polymorphism or inheritance.

3. **What is the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)?**

   * LSP means that objects of a derived class should be replaceable for objects of the base class without affecting program correctness.

4. **How do you achieve Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)?**

   * ISP means creating small, specific interfaces instead of one large interface, ensuring that classes only implement what they need.

5. **What is Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and why is it important?**

   * DIP means high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions, promoting loose coupling and testability.

6. **What is a Design Pattern? Why do we use them?**

   * A Design Pattern is a proven solution to a recurring problem in software design. They make software scalable, maintainable, and reusable.

7. **Explain the Singleton Pattern with an example.**

   * Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point. Example: Database connection manager.

8. **What is the difference between Factory and Abstract Factory Patterns?**

   * Factory creates objects without specifying the exact class, while Abstract Factory creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

9. **How does the Strategy Pattern promote flexibility?**

   * Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable at runtime, promoting flexible code.

10. **When should you use the Observer Pattern?**

* Use Observer Pattern when an object needs to notify multiple objects about state changes without tightly coupling them.
