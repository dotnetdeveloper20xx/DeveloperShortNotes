# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a foundational paradigm in software development. This guide will take you through the core OOP principles in C# with clear explanations, full code examples with comments, and practical best practices.

## Core OOP Principles

1. **Encapsulation**

   * **What:** Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
   * **Why:** Protects data integrity and simplifies maintenance.
   * **How:** Use access modifiers (private, public, protected, internal).

### Code Example (Encapsulation)

```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance; // Private field (Encapsulated)

    public decimal GetBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
        {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance)
        {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Inheritance**

   * **What:** A mechanism to create a new class using properties and behaviors of an existing class.
   * **Why:** Promotes code reuse and hierarchical relationships.
   * **How:** Use the `: baseClass` syntax in C#.

### Code Example (Inheritance)

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating");
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark() => Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking");
}
}
```

3. **Polymorphism**

   * **What:** The ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same type.
   * **Why:** Allows for flexible and scalable code.
   * **How:** Achieved through method overriding and interfaces.

### Code Example (Polymorphism)

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound");
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Cat meows");
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
}
```

4. **Abstraction**

   * **What:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality.
   * **Why:** Simplifies interface usage and increases security.
   * **How:** Use abstract classes or interfaces.

### Code Example (Abstraction)

```csharp
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double CalculateArea();
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius)
    {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

## Watchouts, Do's and Don'ts

* **Encapsulation:** Avoid making fields public; always use properties.
* **Inheritance:** Prefer composition over inheritance if there is no "is-a" relationship.
* **Polymorphism:** Always use `override` when overriding methods.
* **Abstraction:** Keep abstract methods generic; avoid implementation logic in abstract classes.

## Summary: Questions and Answers

1. **What is Encapsulation?**

   * Encapsulation is the concept of hiding internal data and exposing only necessary methods.

2. **How does Inheritance promote code reuse?**

   * Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.

3. **What is Polymorphism, and how is it achieved in C#?**

   * Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as the same type, achieved using method overriding and interfaces.

4. **What is the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface?**

   * Abstract classes can have implementations, while interfaces only define methods.

5. **How do you achieve encapsulation in C#?**

   * By using access modifiers (private, public, protected) to control access to fields and methods.

6. **When should you use Interfaces over Abstract Classes?**

   * Use interfaces for pure contracts without implementation, and abstract classes for partial implementations.

7. **What are the key differences between Inheritance and Composition?**

   * Inheritance creates an "is-a" relationship, while composition creates a "has-a" relationship.

8. **How can Polymorphism lead to flexible code?**

   * It allows methods to be called on objects of different types without knowing their specific type.

9. **What are access modifiers in C#?**

   * Access modifiers define the visibility of class members (public, private, protected, internal).

10. **What are the benefits of using OOP principles?**

* OOP promotes modular, maintainable, reusable, and scalable code.


# SOLID Principles and Design Patterns

## Section 1: SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

   * **What:** A class should have only one reason to change.
   * **Why:** This promotes maintainability and avoids tightly coupled code.
   * **How:** Separate responsibilities into distinct classes.

### Code Example (SRP)

```csharp
public class Order
{
    public void PlaceOrder() => Console.WriteLine("Order Placed.");
}

public class OrderLogger
{
    public void LogOrder() => Console.WriteLine("Order Logged.");
}
```

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

   * **What:** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   * **Why:** This allows new features without altering existing code.
   * **How:** Use inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.

### Code Example (OCP)

```csharp
public interface IDiscount
{
    double ApplyDiscount(double amount);
}

public class NoDiscount : IDiscount
{
    public double ApplyDiscount(double amount) => amount;
}

public class SeasonalDiscount : IDiscount
{
    public double ApplyDiscount(double amount) => amount * 0.9;
}
```

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

   * **What:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
   * **Why:** Prevents unexpected behavior.
   * **How:** Use interfaces or base classes with clear contracts.

### Code Example (LSP)

```csharp
public class Bird
{
    public virtual void Fly() => Console.WriteLine("Bird is flying");
}

public class Sparrow : Bird { }

public class Ostrich : Bird
{
    public override void Fly() => throw new NotSupportedException("Ostrich cannot fly");
}
```

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

   * **What:** Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
   * **Why:** Promotes modularity and flexibility.
   * **How:** Create small, specific interfaces.

### Code Example (ISP)

```csharp
public interface IPrinter
{
    void Print();
}

public interface IScanner
{
    void Scan();
}

public class MultiFunctionPrinter : IPrinter, IScanner
{
    public void Print() => Console.WriteLine("Printing...");
    public void Scan() => Console.WriteLine("Scanning...");
}
```

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

   * **What:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
   * **Why:** Promotes decoupled code.
   * **How:** Use dependency injection and interfaces.

### Code Example (DIP)

```csharp
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

public class ConsoleLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message);
}

public class OrderService
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public OrderService(ILogger logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void ProcessOrder()
    {
        _logger.Log("Order processed.");
    }
}
```

## Section 2: Design Patterns (10 Most Common)

1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype
6. Adapter
7. Decorator
8. Observer
9. Strategy
10. Command

## Watchouts, Do's and Don'ts

* Avoid violating SOLID principles to keep code maintainable.
* Prefer interfaces over concrete classes for dependency injection.
* Ensure design patterns solve real problems, not add unnecessary complexity.

## Summary: Questions and Answers

1. **What is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?**

   * SRP means a class should only have one reason to change. It ensures that each class has one clear responsibility, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

2. **How does the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) support extensibility?**

   * OCP means classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. You can add new functionality without altering existing code, using polymorphism or inheritance.

3. **What is the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)?**

   * LSP means that objects of a derived class should be replaceable for objects of the base class without affecting program correctness.

4. **How do you achieve Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)?**

   * ISP means creating small, specific interfaces instead of one large interface, ensuring that classes only implement what they need.

5. **What is Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and why is it important?**

   * DIP means high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions, promoting loose coupling and testability.

6. **What is a Design Pattern? Why do we use them?**

   * A Design Pattern is a proven solution to a recurring problem in software design. They make software scalable, maintainable, and reusable.

7. **Explain the Singleton Pattern with an example.**

   * Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point. Example: Database connection manager.

8. **What is the difference between Factory and Abstract Factory Patterns?**

   * Factory creates objects without specifying the exact class, while Abstract Factory creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

9. **How does the Strategy Pattern promote flexibility?**

   * Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable at runtime, promoting flexible code.

10. **When should you use the Observer Pattern?**

* Use Observer Pattern when an object needs to notify multiple objects about state changes without tightly coupling them.

# 50 Common Design Patterns in C\#

## Introduction

Design Patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They provide templates for writing flexible, scalable, and maintainable code. This guide covers the 20 most common design patterns in C#, with full code implementations, detailed explanations, use cases, and best practices.

## Section 1: Creational Patterns

### 1. Singleton Pattern

* **Definition:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.
* **When to Use:** Use when you need to ensure only one instance of a class is created, such as a database connection.
* **Similar Patterns to Learn:** Factory Method, Abstract Factory.

```csharp
public sealed class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton _instance = null;
    private static readonly object _lock = new object();

    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            lock (_lock)
            {
                if (_instance == null)
                    _instance = new Singleton();
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Factory Method Pattern

* **Definition:** Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* **When to Use:** Use when you need to delegate object creation to subclasses.
* **Similar Patterns to Learn:** Abstract Factory, Builder.

```csharp
public interface IVehicle
{
    void Drive();
}

public class Car : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Driving a car.");
}

public class Bike : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Riding a bike.");
}

public class VehicleFactory
{
    public static IVehicle CreateVehicle(string type)
    {
        return type switch
        {
            "Car" => new Car(),
            "Bike" => new Bike(),
            _ => throw new ArgumentException("Invalid vehicle type")
        };
    }
}
```

### 3. Abstract Factory Pattern

* **Definition:** Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* **When to Use:** Use when your system needs to work with multiple related object families.
* **Similar Patterns to Learn:** Factory Method, Prototype.

```csharp
public interface IGUIFactory
{
    IButton CreateButton();
}

public class WindowsFactory : IGUIFactory
{
    public IButton CreateButton() => new WindowsButton();
}

public class MacOSFactory : IGUIFactory
{
    public IButton CreateButton() => new MacOSButton();
}
```

### 4. Builder Pattern

## Definition

* **Builder Pattern** is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
* It allows you to create a complex object step by step, giving you more control over the creation process.

## When to Use

* When the creation of an object is complex and involves multiple steps.
* When you want to construct different representations of the same complex object.
* When you want to ensure that the object creation process is clear and maintainable.

## Key Components

* **Builder Interface:** Defines the methods for building different parts of the product.
* **Concrete Builder:** Implements the builder interface to construct and assemble parts of the product.
* **Product:** The final complex object that is created by the builder.
* **Director:** Manages the construction process using the builder.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "Pizza Builder" in a restaurant. The customer (Director) specifies the ingredients and toppings, while the chef (Concrete Builder) uses these instructions to build the final pizza (Product).

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Product

```csharp
// The complex object being built
public class Computer
{
    public string CPU { get; set; }
    public string GPU { get; set; }
    public string RAM { get; set; }
    public string Storage { get; set; }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"CPU: {CPU}, GPU: {GPU}, RAM: {RAM}, Storage: {Storage}";
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Builder Interface

```csharp
// Builder interface specifying the building steps
public interface IComputerBuilder
{
    void SetCPU();
    void SetGPU();
    void SetRAM();
    void SetStorage();
    Computer GetComputer();
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Concrete Builder

```csharp
// Concrete builder implementing the builder interface
public class GamingComputerBuilder : IComputerBuilder
{
    private Computer _computer = new Computer();

    public void SetCPU() => _computer.CPU = "Intel i9";
    public void SetGPU() => _computer.GPU = "NVIDIA RTX 4090";
    public void SetRAM() => _computer.RAM = "32GB DDR5";
    public void SetStorage() => _computer.Storage = "1TB NVMe SSD";

    public Computer GetComputer() => _computer;
}
```

### Step 4: Implement the Director

```csharp
// Director manages the building process
public class ComputerDirector
{
    private readonly IComputerBuilder _builder;

    public ComputerDirector(IComputerBuilder builder)
    {
        _builder = builder;
    }

    public void BuildComputer()
    {
        _builder.SetCPU();
        _builder.SetGPU();
        _builder.SetRAM();
        _builder.SetStorage();
    }

    public Computer GetComputer() => _builder.GetComputer();
}
```

### Step 5: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the builder pattern
var builder = new GamingComputerBuilder();
var director = new ComputerDirector(builder);

director.BuildComputer();
var computer = director.GetComputer();
Console.WriteLine(computer);
```

### Output

```
CPU: Intel i9, GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4090, RAM: 32GB DDR5, Storage: 1TB NVMe SSD
```

## Benefits

* Simplifies object creation with clear steps.
* Makes the creation process flexible and customizable.
* Enforces a step-by-step construction process.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Factory Method:** For creating objects without specifying their exact class.
* **Prototype Pattern:** For creating object clones.

## Common Mistakes (Watchouts)

* Using Builder for simple objects (overkill).
* Mixing Builder responsibilities with Product responsibilities.

## Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Builder Pattern, and why would you use it?**

   * The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It is used when you need to construct a complex object step by step.

2. **How is the Builder Pattern different from the Factory Method Pattern?**

   * Builder Pattern constructs objects step by step, while Factory Method creates objects in one step without exposing the instantiation logic.

3. **What are the roles of the Director and Builder in the Builder Pattern?**

   * The Director manages the construction process, while the Builder handles the creation of the actual object step by step.

4. **Can the Builder Pattern be used without a Director? Why or why not?**

   * Yes, but it is less organized. The Director centralizes the building process, making it more maintainable.

5. **Give a real-world example where the Builder Pattern is most suitable.**

   * Building a complex object like a Computer, Burger, or Pizza where each item has multiple configurable options.

### 5. Prototype Pattern in C\#

## Definition

* **Prototype Pattern** is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object (cloning).
* It helps to avoid the cost of creating an object from scratch.

## When to Use

* When object creation is expensive or complex.
* When you want to create an object that is a copy of another existing object without modifying it.
* When you want to avoid a complex initialization process.

## Key Components

* **Prototype Interface:** Declares a cloning method (Clone).
* **Concrete Prototype:** Implements the cloning method for specific objects.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "Copy Machine" that creates an exact copy of a document. Instead of recreating the document from scratch, you simply make a clone.

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Prototype Interface

```csharp
// Prototype Interface specifying the Clone method
public interface IPrototype
{
    IPrototype Clone();
}
```

### Step 2: Create Concrete Prototype

```csharp
// Concrete prototype implementing the Clone method
public class Document : IPrototype
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Content { get; set; }

    public IPrototype Clone()
    {
        return (IPrototype)MemberwiseClone();
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"Title: {Title}, Content: {Content}";
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the prototype pattern
var originalDocument = new Document { Title = "Design Patterns", Content = "This is a guide on design patterns." };
var clonedDocument = (Document)originalDocument.Clone();

// Modifying the cloned document
clonedDocument.Title = "Cloned Document";

Console.WriteLine("Original: " + originalDocument);
Console.WriteLine("Cloned: " + clonedDocument);
```

### Output

```
Original: Title: Design Patterns, Content: This is a guide on design patterns.
Cloned: Title: Cloned Document, Content: This is a guide on design patterns.
```

## Benefits

* Reduces the cost of creating complex objects from scratch.
* Provides flexibility in creating copies without modifying the original object.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Builder Pattern:** For constructing complex objects step by step.
* **Abstract Factory:** For creating families of related objects.

## Common Mistakes (Watchouts)

* Not implementing deep cloning for complex objects with nested objects.
* Accidentally modifying the original object when using shallow copy.

## Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Prototype Pattern, and why would you use it?**

   * The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that creates objects by copying an existing object (clone). It is useful when object creation is expensive or complex.

2. **How is the Prototype Pattern different from the Builder Pattern?**

   * Prototype Pattern clones an existing object, while Builder Pattern constructs an object step by step.

3. **What is the difference between shallow and deep cloning?**

   * Shallow cloning copies only the top-level structure, while deep cloning copies all nested objects.

4. **How would you implement deep cloning in the Prototype Pattern?**

   * You would manually create a new instance of each nested object instead of using MemberwiseClone.

5. **Give a real-world example where the Prototype Pattern is most suitable.**

   * Creating copies of complex objects like character templates in a game or copying configuration objects in an application.

## Section 2: Structural Patterns

### 6. Adapter Pattern in C\#

## Definition

* **Adapter Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.
* It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, allowing them to communicate.

## When to Use

* When you want to use an existing class, but its interface is not compatible with the system you are working with.
* When you need to integrate classes that were not designed to work together.

## Key Components

* **Target Interface:** The interface that clients expect.
* **Adapter:** Converts the interface of the existing class to match the target interface.
* **Adaptee:** The existing class that needs to be adapted.
* **Client:** Uses the adapter to interact with the adaptee through the target interface.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of an "Electric Socket Adapter." The adapter allows you to plug a device with a different plug type into a socket.

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Target Interface

```csharp
// Target Interface - What the client expects
public interface IAudioPlayer
{
    void Play(string audioType, string fileName);
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Adaptee

```csharp
// Adaptee - Existing incompatible class
public class VLCPlayer
{
    public void PlayVLC(string fileName)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Playing VLC File: {fileName}");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Implement the Adapter

```csharp
// Adapter - Converts the interface of VLCPlayer to IAudioPlayer
public class MediaAdapter : IAudioPlayer
{
    private readonly VLCPlayer _vlcPlayer = new VLCPlayer();

    public void Play(string audioType, string fileName)
    {
        if (audioType.ToLower() == "vlc")
        {
            _vlcPlayer.PlayVLC(fileName);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Unsupported format");
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Create the Client

```csharp
// Client - Uses the Adapter
public class AudioPlayer : IAudioPlayer
{
    private readonly MediaAdapter _adapter = new MediaAdapter();

    public void Play(string audioType, string fileName)
    {
        if (audioType.ToLower() == "vlc")
        {
            _adapter.Play(audioType, fileName);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Playing MP3 File: " + fileName);
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the Adapter Pattern
var audioPlayer = new AudioPlayer();
audioPlayer.Play("mp3", "song.mp3");
audioPlayer.Play("vlc", "video.vlc");
audioPlayer.Play("mp4", "movie.mp4");
```

### Output

```
Playing MP3 File: song.mp3
Playing VLC File: video.vlc
Unsupported format
```

## Benefits

* Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
* Provides flexibility for extending existing systems.
* Promotes code reusability without modifying existing classes.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Bridge Pattern:** Separates an abstraction from its implementation, making them independent.
* **Proxy Pattern:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.

## Common Mistakes (Watchouts)

* Making the Adapter too complex, losing simplicity.
* Misusing Adapter when a simpler solution exists.

## Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Adapter Pattern, and why would you use it?**

   * The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. It is used to integrate incompatible classes.

2. **How is the Adapter Pattern different from the Bridge Pattern?**

   * Adapter makes two incompatible interfaces work together, while Bridge separates an abstraction from its implementation.

3. **What are the components of the Adapter Pattern?**

   * Target Interface, Adapter, Adaptee, and Client.

4. **Can you provide a real-world example of the Adapter Pattern?**

   * An electric socket adapter that allows a device with a different plug type to connect to a socket.

5. **How can you extend the Adapter Pattern to support more formats?**

   * You can enhance the adapter by adding more conditions and support for new formats in the Play method.

---

## 7. Bridge Pattern

## Definition

* **Bridge Pattern** is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation so that they can vary independently.
* It allows you to change the abstraction and the implementation independently without modifying each other.

## When to Use

* When you want to separate an abstraction from its implementation.
* When you want to avoid a rigid inheritance hierarchy.
* When you have multiple variations of an abstraction and you want to keep them decoupled.

## Key Components

* **Abstraction:** Defines the interface and maintains a reference to the implementer.
* **Implementer:** Defines the interface for implementation classes.
* **Concrete Implementer:** Provides specific implementations of the interface.
* **Refined Abstraction:** Extends the abstraction to add more functionality.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "Remote Control" (Abstraction) that can work with different devices like TV, Radio, or Projector (Implementer). The remote can vary independently of the device.

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Implementer Interface

```csharp
// Implementer - Defines the interface for devices
public interface IDevice
{
    void TurnOn();
    void TurnOff();
}
```

### Step 2: Create Concrete Implementers

```csharp
// Concrete Implementer 1 - TV
public class TV : IDevice
{
    public void TurnOn() => Console.WriteLine("TV is now ON.");
    public void TurnOff() => Console.WriteLine("TV is now OFF.");
}

// Concrete Implementer 2 - Radio
public class Radio : IDevice
{
    public void TurnOn() => Console.WriteLine("Radio is now ON.");
    public void TurnOff() => Console.WriteLine("Radio is now OFF.");
}
```

### Step 3: Create the Abstraction

```csharp
// Abstraction - Remote Control
public class RemoteControl
{
    protected IDevice _device;

    public RemoteControl(IDevice device)
    {
        _device = device;
    }

    public virtual void TogglePower()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Toggling Power...");
        _device.TurnOn();
        _device.TurnOff();
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Create Refined Abstraction

```csharp
// Refined Abstraction - Advanced Remote
public class AdvancedRemoteControl : RemoteControl
{
    public AdvancedRemoteControl(IDevice device) : base(device) { }

    public void Mute()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Muting Device...");
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the Bridge Pattern
var tvRemote = new RemoteControl(new TV());
tvRemote.TogglePower();

var radioRemote = new AdvancedRemoteControl(new Radio());
radioRemote.TogglePower();
((AdvancedRemoteControl)radioRemote).Mute();
```

### Output

```
Toggling Power...
TV is now ON.
TV is now OFF.
Toggling Power...
Radio is now ON.
Radio is now OFF.
Muting Device...
```

## Benefits

* Decouples abstraction and implementation, making them independent.
* Allows you to change implementations without modifying abstractions.
* Makes code more flexible and scalable.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Adapter Pattern:** Integrates incompatible interfaces.
* **Composite Pattern:** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

## Common Mistakes (Watchouts)

* Overengineering: Using Bridge Pattern when a simple class hierarchy is sufficient.
* Confusing Bridge Pattern with Adapter Pattern.

## Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Bridge Pattern, and why would you use it?**

   * The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation. It is used to decouple abstraction and implementation, making them independently changeable.

## 8. Composite Pattern

## Definition

* **Composite Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* It treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, allowing clients to work with them in the same way.

## When to Use

* When you need to represent part-whole hierarchies (tree structures).
* When you want to treat individual objects and their compositions uniformly.
* When building hierarchical structures like file systems, menus, or organizational charts.

## Key Components

* **Component:** Declares the interface for objects in the composition.
* **Leaf:** Represents individual objects that do not have children.
* **Composite:** Manages child components and can contain other composite or leaf objects.
* **Client:** Interacts with the component interface, treating all objects uniformly.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "File System." A folder can contain files (leaves) or other folders (composites). The client can treat both files and folders uniformly.

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Component Interface

```csharp
// Component - Defines the common interface
public interface IFileSystemItem
{
    void Display(int depth = 0);
}
```

### Step 2: Create Leaf (Individual Object)

```csharp
// Leaf - Represents a file
public class File : IFileSystemItem
{
    private readonly string _name;

    public File(string name)
    {
        _name = name;
    }

    public void Display(int depth = 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(new string('-', depth) + _name);
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Create Composite (Folder)

```csharp
// Composite - Represents a folder
public class Folder : IFileSystemItem
{
    private readonly string _name;
    private readonly List<IFileSystemItem> _items = new List<IFileSystemItem>();

    public Folder(string name)
    {
        _name = name;
    }

    public void AddItem(IFileSystemItem item)
    {
        _items.Add(item);
    }

    public void Display(int depth = 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(new string('-', depth) + _name);

        foreach (var item in _items)
        {
            item.Display(depth + 2);
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the Composite Pattern
var rootFolder = new Folder("Root");
var subFolder1 = new Folder("Documents");
var subFolder2 = new Folder("Pictures");

rootFolder.AddItem(new File("ReadMe.txt"));
subFolder1.AddItem(new File("Resume.pdf"));
subFolder1.AddItem(new File("Report.docx"));
subFolder2.AddItem(new File("Photo1.png"));
subFolder2.AddItem(new File("Photo2.jpg"));

rootFolder.AddItem(subFolder1);
rootFolder.AddItem(subFolder2);

rootFolder.Display();
```

### Output

```
-Root
--ReadMe.txt
--Documents
----Resume.pdf
----Report.docx
--Pictures
----Photo1.png
----Photo2.jpg
```

## 9. Decorator Pattern

## Definition

* **Decorator Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows you to dynamically add new behaviors or responsibilities to an object without modifying its existing class.
* It is an alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## When to Use

* When you need to add features to an object without modifying its class.
* When you want to add responsibilities to an object at runtime.
* When subclassing is not feasible due to a large number of possible combinations.

## Key Components

* **Component:** Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them.
* **Concrete Component:** The base object that will be decorated.
* **Decorator:** An abstract class that implements the component interface and has a reference to a component.
* **Concrete Decorators:** Add specific behaviors or responsibilities to the component.

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Component Interface

```csharp
// Component - Defines the base interface
public interface ICoffee
{
    string GetDescription();
    double GetCost();
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Concrete Component

```csharp
// Concrete Component - Basic Coffee
public class BasicCoffee : ICoffee
{
    public string GetDescription() => "Basic Coffee";

    public double GetCost() => 2.0;
}

    protected CoffeeDecorator(ICoffee coffee)
    {
        _coffee = coffee;
    }

    public virtual string GetDescription() => _coffee.GetDescription();

    public virtual double GetCost() => _coffee.GetCost();
}
```

### Step 4: Create Concrete Decorators

```csharp
// Concrete Decorator - Milk
public class MilkDecorator : CoffeeDecorator
{
    public MilkDecorator(ICoffee coffee) : base(coffee) { }

    public override string GetDescription() => _coffee.GetDescription() + ", Milk";

    public override double GetCost() => _coffee.GetCost() + 0.5;
}

// Concrete Decorator - Sugar
public class SugarDecorator : CoffeeDecorator
{
    public SugarDecorator(ICoffee coffee) : base(coffee) { }

    public override string GetDescription() => _coffee.GetDescription() + ", Sugar";

    public override double GetCost() => _coffee.GetCost() + 0.2;
}
```

### Step 5: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the Decorator Pattern
ICoffee basicCoffee = new BasicCoffee();
Console.WriteLine($"Description: {basicCoffee.GetDescription()}, Cost: ${basicCoffee.GetCost()}");

// Add Milk
ICoffee milkCoffee = new MilkDecorator(basicCoffee);
Console.WriteLine($"Description: {milkCoffee.GetDescription()}, Cost: ${milkCoffee.GetCost()}");

// Add Sugar
ICoffee sweetMilkCoffee = new SugarDecorator(milkCoffee);
Console.WriteLine($"Description: {sweetMilkCoffee.GetDescription()}, Cost: ${sweetMilkCoffee.GetCost()}");
```

### Output

```
Description: Basic Coffee, Cost: $2.0
Description: Basic Coffee, Milk, Cost: $2.5
Description: Basic Coffee, Milk, Sugar, Cost: $2.7
```

## 10. Facade Pattern

## Definition

* **Facade Pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a complex subsystem.
* It hides the complexity of the subsystem by providing a simple interface for the client.

## When to Use

* When you want to simplify complex subsystems.
* When you want to provide a simple interface for a complex system with multiple classes.
* When you want to decouple clients from complex subsystem components.

## Key Components

* **Subsystem Classes:** The complex classes that the facade interacts with.
* **Client:** Uses the facade to interact with the subsystem without knowing its complexity.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "Restaurant Menu." The customer (Client) can order food using the menu (Facade) without knowing how each dish is prepared in the kitchen (Subsystem).

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Create the Subsystem Classes

```csharp
// Subsystem Class - Order Processing
public class OrderProcessor
{
    public void ProcessOrder(string item)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing order for {item}");
    }
}

// Subsystem Class - Payment Gateway
public class PaymentProcessor
{
    public void ProcessPayment(double amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing payment of ${amount}");
    }
}

// Subsystem Class - Notification Service
public class NotificationService
{
    public void SendNotification(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sending notification: {message}");
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Facade

```csharp
// Facade - Simplified interface for the subsystem
public class OrderFacade
{
    private readonly OrderProcessor _orderProcessor = new OrderProcessor();
    private readonly PaymentProcessor _paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();
    private readonly NotificationService _notificationService = new NotificationService();

    public void PlaceOrder(string item, double amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting Order Process...");
        _orderProcessor.ProcessOrder(item);
        _paymentProcessor.ProcessPayment(amount);
        _notificationService.SendNotification($"Order for {item} has been placed.");
        Console.WriteLine("Order Process Complete.");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the Facade Pattern
var orderFacade = new OrderFacade();
orderFacade.PlaceOrder("Pizza", 15.99);
```

### Output

```
Starting Order Process...
Processing order for Pizza
Processing payment of $15.99
Sending notification: Order for Pizza has been placed.
Order Process Complete.
```

## Benefits

4. **Can you provide a real-world example of the Facade Pattern?**

   * A restaurant menu (Facade) that allows customers to order food without knowing how each dish is prepared (Subsystem).

5. **How would you extend the Facade Pattern to add more features?**

   * By adding more methods to the Facade class that combine subsystem functionality in different ways.


## 11. Flyweight Pattern

## Definition

* **Flyweight Pattern** is a structural design pattern that reduces memory usage by sharing common state among multiple objects.
* It optimizes resource usage by minimizing the number of objects created.

## When to Use

* When you need to create a large number of similar objects.
* When memory consumption is a concern.
* When most of the object data can be shared across multiple instances.

## Key Components

* **Flyweight Interface:** Declares methods for sharing intrinsic state.
* **Concrete Flyweight:** Implements the flyweight interface and shares intrinsic state.
* **Unshared Concrete Flyweight:** Objects that do not share state.
* **Flyweight Factory:** Manages the creation and reuse of flyweight objects.
* **Client:** Uses the flyweight objects via the factory.

## Real-World Analogy

* Think of a "Text Editor" that displays repeated characters on the screen. Instead of creating a new object for each character, it uses the same object for each repeated character (like the letter 'A').

## Full C# Example with Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Flyweight Interface

```csharp
// Flyweight Interface
public interface IShape
{
    void Draw(string color);
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Concrete Flyweight

```csharp
// Concrete Flyweight - Circle
public class Circle : IShape
{
    private readonly string _shapeType = "Circle";

    public void Draw(string color)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Drawing {_shapeType} with color {color}");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Create the Flyweight Factory

```csharp
// Flyweight Factory - Manages flyweight instances
public class ShapeFactory
{
    private static readonly Dictionary<string, IShape> _shapes = new();

    public static IShape GetShape(string shapeType)
    {
        if (!_shapes.ContainsKey(shapeType))
        {
            _shapes[shapeType] = new Circle();
            Console.WriteLine($"Creating new {shapeType} object.");
        }

        return _shapes[shapeType];
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the Flyweight Pattern
var circle1 = ShapeFactory.GetShape("Circle");
circle1.Draw("Red");

var circle2 = ShapeFactory.GetShape("Circle");
circle2.Draw("Green");

var circle3 = ShapeFactory.GetShape("Circle");
circle3.Draw("Blue");
```

### Output

```
Creating new Circle object.
Drawing Circle with color Red
Drawing Circle with color Green
Drawing Circle with color Blue
```

## Benefits

* Reduces memory usage by sharing objects.
* Increases efficiency when dealing with a large number of similar objects.

## Similar Patterns to Learn

* **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance.
* **Prototype Pattern:** Creates objects by copying an existing object (clone).

## Common Mistakes (Watchouts)

* Misusing Flyweight for objects with unique state (should only be used for shared state).
* Overcomplicating the Flyweight Factory with too many conditions.

## Interview Questions with Answers

1. **What is the Flyweight Pattern, and why would you use it?**

   * The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern that reduces memory usage by sharing common state among multiple objects. It is used to optimize memory in large systems.

2. **How is the Flyweight Pattern different from the Singleton Pattern?**

   * Flyweight shares common state across multiple objects, while Singleton ensures only one instance of an object exists.

3. **What is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic state in Flyweight Pattern?**

   * Intrinsic state is shared and remains the same, while extrinsic state is passed externally and can vary.

4. **Can you provide a real-world example of the Flyweight Pattern?**

   * A text editor reusing character objects for frequently used letters like 'A' instead of creating a new object each time.

5. **How would you extend the Flyweight Pattern to support more shapes?**

   * By adding more shape classes (e.g., Square, Triangle) and handling them in the ShapeFactory.

    public string GetOrderDetails() => "Order Details: Product X";
}

// Usage
var commandHandler = new OrderCommandHandler();
commandHandler.Handle(new CreateOrderCommand { ProductName = "Laptop" });

var query = new OrderQuery();
Console.WriteLine(query.GetOrderDetails());

# Mastering Dependency Injection (DI) in ASP.NET Core

## Introduction

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that enables loose coupling between components in an application. In ASP.NET Core, DI is a first-class citizen and is natively supported by the framework.

### What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection is a technique where an object’s dependencies are provided externally, rather than the object creating them itself.

* **Why Use DI?**: It improves code maintainability, testability, and scalability.
* **How DI Works in ASP.NET Core?**: ASP.NET Core uses a built-in DI container that supports three main lifetimes: Transient, Scoped, and Singleton.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Types of Dependency Injection

* **Constructor Injection (Most Common)**: Dependencies are provided via the constructor.

  ```csharp
  public class NotificationService
  {
      private readonly IMessageService _messageService;

      public NotificationService(IMessageService messageService)
      {
          _messageService = messageService;
      }

      public void Notify(string message)
      {
          Console.WriteLine(_messageService.SendMessage(message));
      }
  }
  ```

* **Property Injection (Setter Injection)**: Dependencies are set via properties.

  ```csharp
  public class NotificationService
  {
      public IMessageService MessageService { get; set; }

      public void Notify(string message)
      {
          Console.WriteLine(MessageService?.SendMessage(message));
      }
  }
  ```

* **Method Injection**: Dependencies are passed as method parameters.

  ```csharp
  public class NotificationService
  {
      public void Notify(IMessageService messageService, string message)
      {
          Console.WriteLine(messageService.SendMessage(message));
      }
  }
  ```

### 2. DI Lifetime Scopes (In-Depth)

* **Transient**: A new instance is created each time the service is requested.

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddTransient<ITransientService, TransientService>();
  ```

* **Scoped**: A new instance is created once per request (HTTP request in a web app).

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddScoped<IScopedService, ScopedService>();
  ```

* **Singleton**: A single instance is created for the lifetime of the application.

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddSingleton<ISingletonService, SingletonService>();
  ```

## Advanced DI Techniques

* Using Factory Pattern with DI
* Implementing Scoped Services with Async Context
* DI in Middleware
* Conditional DI (based on environment)

## Watchouts

* Avoid injecting too many dependencies (Constructor Over-Injection).
* Use appropriate lifetime for services (Singleton for stateless services).
* Be careful with Scoped services in Singleton.
* Circular Dependencies should be avoided.
* Avoid using static services with DI.

## Summary

### Question and Answer Mastery

1. **What is Dependency Injection (DI)?**

   * DI is a design pattern where dependencies are injected into a class rather than the class creating them.

2. **Why should you use DI in ASP.NET Core?**

   * It promotes loose coupling, enhances testability, and improves maintainability.

3. **What are the three main service lifetimes in DI?**

   * Transient, Scoped, and Singleton.

4. **How do you register a service in DI in ASP.NET Core?**

   * Using `builder.Services.AddTransient`, `AddScoped`, or `AddSingleton` methods in Program.cs.

5. **What is Constructor Injection?**

   * Dependency is provided through the constructor of the class.

6. **What is Scoped Service?**

   * A service instance is created once per HTTP request.

7. **How does Singleton differ from Transient?**

   * Singleton creates a single instance for the application's lifetime, while Transient creates a new instance on every request.

8. **How do you resolve services manually?**

   * Using `IServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<T>()`.

9. **What is the risk of injecting Scoped services in Singleton?**

   * Scoped service instances may become singletons when injected into a Singleton, leading to unexpected behavior.

10. **How can you use DI in Middleware?**

* By injecting services via the constructor of the Middleware class.


# Mastering Middleware and Filters in ASP.NET Core

## Introduction

Middleware and Filters are two powerful concepts in ASP.NET Core that control how HTTP requests and responses flow through an application.

### What is Middleware?

Middleware is software that is assembled into an application pipeline to handle HTTP requests and responses. Each middleware component decides:

* Whether to pass the request to the next middleware.
* Whether to process the request and response.

### Why Use Middleware?

* Centralized request/response handling.
* Logging, Authentication, Exception Handling, CORS, and more.

### How Middleware Works?

* Middleware is added in `Program.cs` using `app.UseMiddleware<>()` or `app.Use()` methods.
* Order matters – Middleware is processed in the sequence it is added.
* Each middleware can decide to terminate the pipeline or pass the request to the next.

### Middleware vs Filters (Clear Comparison)

* **Middleware**: Affects the entire request pipeline, including static files, authentication, etc.
* **Filters**: Specific to MVC (Controller) actions, executing around action methods.

## Types of Middleware

1. Built-in Middleware (Exception Handling, Static Files, Routing, CORS).
2. Custom Middleware (User-defined logic).
3. Conditional Middleware (Environment-specific).

## Creating Custom Middleware (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Create a Custom Middleware Class

```csharp
public class RequestLoggingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public RequestLoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Request: {context.Request.Method} {context.Request.Path}");
        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Register Middleware in Pipeline

```csharp
app.UseMiddleware<RequestLoggingMiddleware>();
```

### Step 3: Test the Middleware

* Any HTTP request will now be logged.

### Advanced Custom Middleware with Dependency Injection

```csharp
public class HeaderInjectionMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger<HeaderInjectionMiddleware> _logger;

    public HeaderInjectionMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<HeaderInjectionMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        context.Response.OnStarting(() => {
            context.Response.Headers["X-Custom-Header"] = "Middleware Added Header";
            _logger.LogInformation("Custom Header Added");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        });

        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

### Registering the Advanced Middleware

```csharp
app.UseMiddleware<HeaderInjectionMiddleware>();
```

## Middleware Ordering Explained (Critical Concept)

* Order of middleware registration in `Program.cs` directly affects execution.
* Example:

```csharp
app.UseRouting(); // Routing Middleware
app.UseAuthentication(); // Authentication Middleware
app.UseAuthorization(); // Authorization Middleware
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => endpoints.MapControllers());
```

## Deep Dive into Filters

Filters are used to execute code before or after specific stages of request processing in MVC controllers.

### Types of Filters (In-Depth)

1. **Authorization Filters** - Validate user authentication and authorization.
2. **Resource Filters** - Execute before or after the entire request pipeline.
3. **Action Filters** - Execute code before or after an action method.
4. **Exception Filters** - Handle exceptions globally or locally.
5. **Result Filters** - Execute code before or after the action result.

### Implementing a Custom Action Filter

```csharp
public class CustomActionFilter : IActionFilter
{
    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Action Executing");
    }

    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Action Executed");
    }
}
```

### Applying Filter Globally

```csharp
builder.Services.AddControllers(options =>
{
    options.Filters.Add<CustomActionFilter>();
});
```

## Advanced Middleware and Filters Techniques

* Exception Handling Middleware with Custom Response
* Conditional Middleware (Using Environment Checks)
* Using Dependency Injection in Middleware
* Applying Filters Globally (Global Filters)
* Combining Middleware and Filters for Secure APIs

## Watchouts

* Middleware order is critical (Pipeline Sequence).
* Filters do not apply to non-MVC requests (like Web API).
* Avoid long-running tasks in Middleware.
* Be aware of filter conflicts (Authorization vs Action Filters).
* Avoid circular dependencies in Middleware.

## Summary

### Question and Answer Mastery

1. **What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?**

   * Middleware is a software component that processes HTTP requests and responses.

2. **How do you create Custom Middleware?**

   * By creating a class with an `InvokeAsync` method and registering it using `app.UseMiddleware<>`.

3. **What is the difference between Use, Run, and Map in Middleware?**

   * `Use`: Continues to next middleware.
   * `Run`: Terminates the pipeline.
   * `Map`: Conditionally branches the pipeline.

4. **What are Filters?**

   * Filters are components that run before or after specific stages of the request pipeline in controllers.

5. **What are the types of Filters?**

   * Authorization, Resource, Action, Exception, Result.

6. **How do you apply a Filter to a Controller?**

   * Using `[ServiceFilter]`, `[TypeFilter]`, or `[Authorize]`.

7. **How do you create a Custom Action Filter?**

   * By implementing `IActionFilter` and registering it.

8. **How do Middleware and Filters differ?**

   * Middleware is for the entire HTTP request pipeline, while Filters are for MVC actions.

9. **What is the significance of Middleware order?**

   * The order determines how requests are processed.

10. **How do you inject services in Middleware?**

* Using the constructor of the Middleware class with DI.

# Mastering Memory Management in ASP.NET Core

## Introduction

Memory management is a critical concept for any .NET developer, especially when building high-performance web applications with ASP.NET Core. Understanding how memory is allocated, managed, and freed is essential for writing efficient and scalable code.

### Why Memory Management is Important?

* Prevents memory leaks.
* Enhances application performance.
* Reduces unnecessary resource consumption.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Garbage Collection (GC)

* **What is Garbage Collection?**

  * Garbage Collection (GC) is an automatic memory management system in .NET.
  * It automatically frees memory that is no longer in use, preventing memory leaks.

* **GC Generations (Detailed):**

  * **Generation 0:** Short-lived objects. (e.g., local variables, temporary data)
  * **Generation 1:** Medium-lived objects. (e.g., cached data)
  * **Generation 2:** Long-lived objects. (e.g., static objects, global instances)

* **GC Modes (Advanced):**

  * **Workstation (Default for desktops):** Optimized for client applications.
  * **Server (Optimized for high-performance servers):** Multi-threaded collection.
  * **Background GC:** Runs concurrently with application code.

### 2. IDisposable and Using Statement

* **What is IDisposable?**

  * An interface that allows manual resource cleanup, especially for unmanaged resources.

* **Using Statement Explained:**

  ```csharp
  using (var stream = new FileStream("example.txt", FileMode.Open))
  {
      // File is automatically disposed of at the end of the block
  }
  ```

  * Using statement ensures that the resource is properly disposed even if an exception occurs.

* **Implementing IDisposable with Dispose Pattern:**

  ```csharp
  public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable
  {
      private bool _disposed = false;

      public void UseResource()
      {
          if (_disposed) throw new ObjectDisposedException("ResourceHolder");
          Console.WriteLine("Using Resource");
      }

      public void Dispose()
      {
          Dispose(true);
          GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
      }

      protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
      {
          if (_disposed) return;

          if (disposing)
          {
              // Release managed resources
              Console.WriteLine("Disposing managed resources");
          }

          // Release unmanaged resources
          Console.WriteLine("Disposing unmanaged resources");
          _disposed = true;
      }

      ~ResourceHolder()
      {
          Dispose(false);
      }
  }
  ```

### 3. Value Types vs Reference Types (Deep Dive)

* **Value Types:**

  * Stored in the stack.
  * Examples: `int`, `double`, `struct`, `bool`.
  * Memory is allocated immediately and destroyed once the method ends.

* **Reference Types:**

  * Stored in the heap.
  * Examples: `class`, `interface`, `array`, `string`.
  * Memory is managed by Garbage Collector.

### 4. Stack vs Heap Memory (In-Depth)

* **Stack Memory:**

  * Fast access (Last-In, First-Out - LIFO).
  * Stores value types and method call data.

* **Heap Memory:**

  * Slower but allows dynamic memory allocation.
  * Stores reference types and long-lived objects.

## Advanced Memory Management Techniques

### 1. Handling Large Object Heap (LOH)

* Objects larger than 85,000 bytes are stored in LOH.
* LOH is not compacted by default, which can cause memory fragmentation.
* Use `GCSettings.LargeObjectHeapCompactionMode` for manual compaction.

### 2. Avoiding Memory Leaks

* Always dispose of IDisposable objects.
* Use `WeakReference<T>` for cache without preventing GC.
* Avoid static event handlers (they prevent GC).

### 3. Understanding Finalization

* Finalizers (`~ClassName`) are called by GC before object destruction.
* Avoid long-running tasks in finalizers.

### 4. Advanced Tips

* Use `ArrayPool<T>` for reusable large arrays.
* Use `GC.Collect()` only for testing, not in production.
* Prefer `Span<T>` and `Memory<T>` for low-level optimizations.

## Watchouts

* Avoid memory leaks by disposing of resources properly.
* Be careful with large object allocations (LOH).
* Avoid circular references in managed objects.
* Do not call `GC.Collect()` in production.
* Understand the difference between Stack and Heap allocations.

## Summary

### Question and Answer Mastery

1. **What is Garbage Collection (GC) in .NET?**

   * GC is an automatic memory management system that reclaims unused objects.

2. **What are the GC generations?**

   * Generation 0 (short-lived), Generation 1 (medium-lived), Generation 2 (long-lived).

3. **What is the difference between stack and heap?**

   * Stack is for value types and method calls (LIFO), while Heap is for reference types and long-lived objects.

4. **What is IDisposable, and why is it important?**

   * IDisposable is an interface for manual resource cleanup, avoiding memory leaks.

5. **How does the `using` statement help with memory management?**

   * It ensures IDisposable objects are automatically disposed of when out of scope.

6. **What are Value Types and Reference Types?**

   * Value Types are stored in the stack, Reference Types are stored in the heap.

7. **How does the Dispose Pattern work?**

   * It provides a safe way to release both managed and unmanaged resources.

8. **What is the Large Object Heap (LOH)?**

   * A special heap for objects larger than 85,000 bytes.

9. **How do you prevent memory leaks in ASP.NET Core?**

   * Dispose of unmanaged resources, avoid static event handlers, use `WeakReference`.

10. **What is the difference between a weak reference and a strong reference?**

* A weak reference allows GC to collect the object even if it is referenced.


# Mastering ASP.NET Core Internals for Senior Developers

## Introduction

ASP.NET Core is a powerful, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, and cross-platform web applications. Understanding its internals is essential for senior developers who want to write optimized, scalable, and secure applications.

## Core Concepts

### 1. ASP.NET Core Request Processing Pipeline

* **What is the Request Pipeline?**

  * It is a series of middleware components that process HTTP requests and responses.
  * Each request goes through this pipeline, and each middleware can either process the request or pass it to the next.

* **How does it work? (Detailed Flow)**

  1. HTTP Request received by the Kestrel Server.
  2. Middleware processes the request in order (Exception Handling, Static Files, Routing).
  3. Routing Middleware identifies the matching route.
  4. MVC Middleware (Controller) processes the request.
  5. HTTP Response is sent back to the client.

### Request Pipeline Diagram

```plaintext
Client → Kestrel → Middleware 1 → Middleware 2 → Routing → Controller → Middleware 3 → Response
```

### 2. Hosting Model

* **Kestrel Web Server (Built-in)**

  * High-performance, cross-platform web server.
  * Can run as a standalone server or behind a reverse proxy (e.g., IIS, Nginx).

* **In-Process vs Out-of-Process Hosting (Detailed)**

  * **In-Process:** Runs directly inside IIS worker process (w3wp.exe).
  * **Out-of-Process:** Kestrel runs independently, with IIS as a reverse proxy.

### 3. Dependency Injection (DI) System

* **Built-in DI Container**

  * Supports Transient, Scoped, and Singleton lifetimes.

* **How DI Works Internally? (Advanced)**

  * Services are registered in the DI container.
  * DI resolves services using Constructor Injection.
  * The lifetime of each service is determined by its registration type (Transient, Scoped, Singleton).

### 4. Middleware Architecture

* Middleware are components that intercept HTTP requests.
* **Order Matters:** The order in which middleware is registered determines the flow.
* Example:

  ```csharp
  app.UseRouting();
  app.UseAuthentication();
  app.UseAuthorization();
  app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => endpoints.MapControllers());
  ```

### 5. Configuration System (In-Depth)

* **Multi-Source Configuration:** Supports JSON, XML, Environment Variables, Command Line, Azure Key Vault.
* **Configuration Providers:** Hierarchical key-value system (appsettings.json, appsettings.Development.json).
* **Accessing Configuration Values:**

  ```csharp
  var configValue = builder.Configuration["MySetting:SubSetting"];
  ```

### 6. Hosting and Startup

* **Program.cs and Startup.cs (ASP.NET Core 3.1 and below)**

  * Program.cs: Configures WebHost.
  * Startup.cs: Configures Services and Middleware.

* **Unified Hosting Model (ASP.NET Core 6 and above)**

  * Single Program.cs with WebApplicationBuilder.

  ```csharp
  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
  var app = builder.Build();
  app.Run();
  ```

### 7. Logging System (Detailed)

* **Integrated Logging Providers:** Console, Debug, EventSource, Application Insights.
* **Structured Logging with Serilog:**

  ```csharp
  builder.Logging.ClearProviders();
  builder.Logging.AddSerilog(new LoggerConfiguration().WriteTo.Console().CreateLogger());
  ```
* **Log Levels:** Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical.

### 8. Exception Handling

* **Global Exception Handling Middleware:**

  ```csharp
  app.UseExceptionHandler(errorApp =>
  {
      errorApp.Run(async context =>
      {
          context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";
          await context.Response.WriteAsync("{"Error":"An unexpected error occurred"}");
      });
  });
  ```

## Advanced Internals

* **Application Lifecycle:** How ASP.NET Core initializes and handles requests.
* **Threading and Async Programming:** Handling asynchronous requests efficiently.
* **Performance Optimization:** Response Caching, Compression, Connection Pooling.
* **Security Mechanisms:** Authentication, Authorization, CORS, Data Protection.
* **Advanced Configuration:** Environment-Specific Configuration, Secret Management, Azure Key Vault.
* **WebHostBuilder and GenericHostBuilder:** Understanding the hosting model.

## Watchouts

* Misconfiguring the middleware order can break the application.
* Be cautious with Singleton services that rely on Scoped services.
* Avoid tight coupling in DI (prefer interface-based injections).
* Always test configurations in production-like environments.

## Summary

### Question and Answer Mastery

1. **What is the ASP.NET Core request processing pipeline?**

   * It is a series of middleware components that handle HTTP requests and responses in a specific order.

2. **What is Kestrel, and how does it differ from IIS?**

   * Kestrel is a cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core, while IIS is a Windows-only web server that can proxy requests to Kestrel.

3. **How does Dependency Injection (DI) work internally?**

   * DI is managed by a built-in container that resolves services based on their registration (Transient, Scoped, Singleton).

4. **What are the different DI lifetimes?**

   * Transient (per request), Scoped (per HTTP request), Singleton (one instance for the app).

5. **What is the difference between In-Process and Out-of-Process Hosting?**

   * In-Process runs directly in IIS, while Out-of-Process uses Kestrel with IIS as a reverse proxy.

6. **What is the role of Program.cs and Startup.cs?**

   * Program.cs configures the host, Startup.cs configures services and middleware (pre-ASP.NET Core 6).

7. **How do you set up global exception handling?**

   * Using `app.UseExceptionHandler` with a custom handler in `Program.cs`.

8. **What is the purpose of the Configuration System?**

   * To provide hierarchical, multi-source configuration for the application.

9. **How does the Logging System work?**

   * Integrated with multiple providers (Console, Serilog, Application Insights), supports structured logging.

10. **What are best practices for Middleware configuration?**

* Use correct order, avoid long-running tasks, and secure sensitive endpoints.

# Mastering Configuration and Logging in ASP.NET Core

## Introduction

Configuration and Logging are two critical aspects of any ASP.NET Core application. They ensure that applications can be easily configured for different environments and that errors can be diagnosed efficiently.

## Configuration in ASP.NET Core

### 1. What is Configuration?

* ASP.NET Core supports hierarchical configuration using key-value pairs.
* It allows for flexibility across different environments (Development, Staging, Production).

### 2. Configuration Sources (Comprehensive)

* **JSON Files:** appsettings.json, appsettings.Development.json.
* **Environment Variables:** OS-level configuration values.
* **Command-Line Arguments:** Configuration values passed during app startup.
* **User Secrets:** Secure storage for sensitive values (Development only).
* **Azure Key Vault:** Securely store and manage application secrets in Azure.
* **In-Memory Collection:** Useful for testing configurations.
* **INI Files and XML Files:** Alternative configuration formats.

### 3. Configuring Application Settings

* Example: appsettings.json

```json
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "SiteTitle": "My ASP.NET Core App",
    "MaxUserCount": 100,
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=myServer;Database=myDB;User Id=myUser;Password=myPass;"
    }
  }
}
```

* Accessing Configuration Values

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var siteTitle = builder.Configuration["AppSettings:SiteTitle"];
var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");
Console.WriteLine($"Site Title: {siteTitle}");
```

### 4. Environment-Specific Configuration

* Supports separate configurations for different environments (Development, Staging, Production).
* Automatically loads the correct appsettings file based on environment.
* Example: appsettings.Development.json

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Debug",
      "Microsoft": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Secret Management

* User Secrets for local development (secure sensitive information).

  ```bash
  dotnet user-secrets init
  dotnet user-secrets set "AppSettings:ApiKey" "my-secret-key"
  ```
* Azure Key Vault for production (secure secrets storage).

  * Securely access secrets without hardcoding them.

### 6. Strongly Typed Configuration (Advanced)

* Bind configuration values directly to a class.

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<AppSettings>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AppSettings"));

public class AppSettings
{
    public string SiteTitle { get; set; }
    public int MaxUserCount { get; set; }
}
```

* Accessing Strongly Typed Configuration

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly AppSettings _appSettings;

    public HomeController(IOptions<AppSettings> options)
    {
        _appSettings = options.Value;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()

    public HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Home page accessed.");
        return View();
    }
}
```

### 5. Structured Logging with Serilog (Advanced)

* Serilog is a popular logging library for ASP.NET Core.
* Supports structured logging (JSON format).

```csharp
using Serilog;

builder.Logging.ClearProviders();
builder.Logging.AddSerilog(new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.Console()
    .WriteTo.File("logs/log.txt", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)
    .CreateLogger());
```

### 6. Log Levels Explained (Advanced)

* Trace: Most detailed logs.
* Debug: Development-level logs.
* Information: General information.
* Warning: Unexpected situations, but not errors.
* Error: Error conditions.
* Critical: Severe errors that cause termination.

# Mastering Security and Identity in ASP.NET Core

## Introduction

Security and Identity are fundamental to building secure and scalable ASP.NET Core applications. This guide covers authentication, authorization, identity management, JWT, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and best practices for secure API development.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Authentication vs Authorization

* **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of a user.

  * Examples: Login with username and password, OAuth login with Google.
* **Authorization:** Determines what authenticated users can access.

  * Examples: Admin access, User read-only access.

### 2. Authentication Mechanisms (Detailed)

* **Cookie Authentication:** Uses cookies to track user sessions (stateful).
* **JWT Authentication (JSON Web Tokens):** Secure, stateless authentication for APIs.
* **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Secure authentication using external providers (Google, Facebook).

### 3. ASP.NET Core Identity (Comprehensive)

* **What is Identity?**

  * A complete user management system for ASP.NET Core.
  * Supports user registration, login, password management, two-factor authentication, email confirmation.

* **Configuring Identity in ASP.NET Core**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddIdentity<IdentityUser, IdentityRole>(options =>
{
    options.Password.RequireDigit = true;
    options.Password.RequiredLength = 8;
    options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedEmail = true;
})
.AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>()
.AddDefaultTokenProviders();
```

### 4. Secure Password Storage

* Passwords are hashed using secure hashing algorithms (PBKDF2, BCrypt).
* Example: Configuring password strength in Identity

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<IdentityOptions>(options =>
{
    options.Password.RequireDigit = true;
    options.Password.RequiredLength = 8;
    options.Password.RequireUppercase = true;
    options.Password.RequireNonAlphanumeric = true;
});
```

### 5. Role-Based Authorization (Granular)

* Example: Admin Role

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public class AdminController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Dashboard()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

* Dynamically Adding Roles

```csharp
var roleManager = app.Services.GetRequiredService<RoleManager<IdentityRole>>();
await roleManager.CreateAsync(new IdentityRole("Admin"));
```

### 6. Policy-Based Authorization (Advanced)

* Fine-grained control over authorization.
* Example: Creating a custom policy

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("RequireAdmin", policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
    options.AddPolicy("AgeRequirement", policy => policy.RequireClaim("Age", "18"));
});
```

* Applying Policy in Controller

```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdmin")]
public class SecureController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult SecureArea()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

### 7. JWT Authentication (JSON Web Tokens) (Detailed)

* Configuring JWT in Startup

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
.AddJwtBearer(options =>
{
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        ValidateIssuer = true,
        ValidateAudience = true,
        ValidateLifetime = true,
        ValidIssuer = "https://yourdomain.com",
        ValidAudience = "https://yourdomain.com",
        IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("YourSecretKey"))
    };
});
```

* Generating JWT Token

```csharp
public string GenerateJwtToken(string username)
{
    var claims = new[]
    {
        new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub, username),
        new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Jti, Guid.NewGuid().ToString())
    };

    var key = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("YourSecretKey"));
    var creds = new SigningCredentials(key, SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256);

    var token = new JwtSecurityToken(
        issuer: "https://yourdomain.com",
        audience: "https://yourdomain.com",
        claims: claims,
        expires: DateTime.Now.AddHours(1),
        signingCredentials: creds
    );

    return new JwtSecurityTokenHandler().WriteToken(token);
}
```

### 8. Advanced Security Techniques

* Custom Claims and Policies.
* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with Email or SMS.
* Secure Cookies with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`.
* Rate Limiting to prevent API abuse.

* **What is HTTP Parameter Pollution?**

  * Multiple values for a single parameter can lead to unexpected behavior.

* **How to Prevent:**

  * Use model binding with strong types in ASP.NET Core.

  ```csharp
  public IActionResult Search(string query)
  {
      if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(query))
      {
          return BadRequest("Query cannot be empty.");
      }
  }
  ```

### 15. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

* **What is SSRF?**

  * An attack where the server makes HTTP requests to an internal system at an attacker’s request.

* **How to Prevent SSRF:**

  * Restrict outgoing HTTP requests to trusted domains.
  * Use HttpClientFactory with strict configurations.

### 16. Remote Code Execution (RCE)

* **What is RCE?**

  * Allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the server.

* **How to Prevent:**

  * Do not execute untrusted code (e.g., Shell commands).
  * Avoid deserializing untrusted data.

### 17. Mass Assignment

* **What is Mass Assignment?**

  * When properties of a model can be set by user input without restriction.

* **How to Prevent:**

  * Use ViewModels or DTOs instead of directly binding user input to models.

  ```csharp
  public class UserDto
  {
      public string Username { get; set; }
      public string Email { get; set; }
  }
  ```

### 18. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfiguration

* **What is CORS Misconfiguration?**

  * Incorrectly allowing all origins to access APIs.

* **How to Secure CORS:**

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
  {
      options.AddPolicy("SecurePolicy",
          builder => builder.WithOrigins("https://trusted-domain.com")
                            .AllowAnyMethod()
                            .AllowAnyHeader());
  });

  app.UseCors("SecurePolicy");
  ```

### 19. Cache Poisoning

* **What is Cache Poisoning?**

  * Manipulating cached responses to deliver malicious content to users.

* **How to Prevent:**

  * Use secure cache headers.

  ```csharp
  app.Use(async (context, next) =>
  {
      context.Response.Headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-store";
      await next.Invoke();
  });
  ```

### 20. Insecure HTTP Methods

* **What is the Risk?**

  * Allowing unsafe HTTP methods (e.g., TRACE, DELETE).

* **How to Secure HTTP Methods:**

  ```csharp
  app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
  {
      endpoints.MapControllers().WithMetadata(new HttpMethodMetadata(new[] { "GET", "POST" }));
  });
  ```

## Advanced Security Practices

* Implementing Rate Limiting with ASP.NET Core.
* Using Secure Cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite attributes.
* Securing APIs with API Keys and OAuth2.
* Using Content Security Policy (CSP) for XSS protection.
* Automating Security Scans (e.g., OWASP ZAP).

## Summary

### Question and Answer Mastery

1. **What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?**

   * CSRF is an attack where a malicious website tricks a user into performing an action on another site where they are authenticated.

2. **How do you prevent CSRF in ASP.NET Core?**

   * Use Anti-Forgery Tokens with `@Html.AntiForgeryToken()` and `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]`.

3. **What is SSRF, and how do you prevent it?**

   * SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) tricks a server into making requests to unintended destinations. Prevent it by restricting outgoing HTTP requests.

4. **How do you prevent Insecure Object References?**

   * Use GUIDs instead of sequential IDs, and implement Role-Based Authorization.

5. **What is Remote Code Execution (RCE), and how do you avoid it?**

   * RCE allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the server. Avoid it by not executing untrusted code or deserializing untrusted data.

6. **What is CORS Misconfiguration, and how do you secure it?**

   * Incorrectly allowing all origins to access APIs. Secure by restricting origins using `builder.Services.AddCors`.

7. **How do you prevent Cache Poisoning?**

   * Use secure cache headers (`Cache-Control: no-store`).

8. **What is Mass Assignment, and how do you prevent it?**

   * Automatically binding user input to model properties. Prevent with DTOs or ViewModels.

9. **What is HTTP Parameter Pollution, and how do you secure it?**

   * Multiple values for a single parameter causing unexpected behavior. Use strong model binding.

10. **What are the best practices for securing HTTP methods?**

* Restrict allowed HTTP methods using `MapControllers()` with specified methods (GET, POST).
